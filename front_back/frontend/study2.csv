430,NA
431,"While I can honestly say I find them both repugnant, Hilary I very much believe is completely dishonest...a grifter. / I think she is a serial liar and thinks she is due the presidency. WHILE Trump I / agree is a blow-hard, I think he loves his country."

440,"i think both candidates have made mistakes, but donald trump is far worse than clinton"
441,Both are terrible candidates for different reasons. I voted early and did not vote for either of them. The 2 party system is ridiculous and undemocratic.
442,Trump is not just wrong. He is unstable and colloquially I could say crazy.  Hillary is intelligent if flawed but the better leader.
443,I Think both are very deeply flawed and think both will have issues as president. I Think Clinton has a bad history of lying and while I do not agree with most of Trump he does tell the truth. I think this is a scary election.

447,"Donald Trump is a charlatan. He has spent his whole life doing things in his own self interest, and now wants people to believe he is suddenly out to represent them.

455,Hillary is a great candidate with great credentials.  I think she will make a good president.  Donald Trump has limited to no working knowledge of the U.S government or international affairs; I can't begin to fathom how he will perform the job of president.
456,NA
457,"Donald Trump is a national security threat. He's expressed many times that he doesn't have an interest in trying to have a relationship with other countries, and he essentially wants to bomb everyone. The comments he's made regarding just about every gender/race/religion is terrible. He's putting hatred in to everyone's minds and it's awful. He doesn't morally align with where I lie (pro choice, women's rights, gay rights, etc) and doesn't believe in global warming which is a major concern at this point. Hilary has plans to help with global warming, wants to continue to grow relationships with other countries, and believes in a women's right to choose. "
458,"Hillary Clinton is brilliant but compromised, and will bring with her baggage of small-level controversies, but she will move the country in the right direction. Donald Trump is a dangerous meglomaniac and the closest this country has ever come to jeopardizing democracy."
459,Good support for the best candiadte possible
460,"Go Hillary, Boo trump!"
461,"i think that Donald Trump is the lesser of two evils.  I believe that if he is elected he will surround himself with people who are as smart, if not smarter than himself.  I believe that if Hillary is elected her decisions will go unchecked. "
462,Trump is raw and says whatever he wants to say.  I'm not sure what he would do as President.  Hillary seems to have Democratic values and will probably help the middle class.  She isn't as warm as Obama and may possibly be hypocritic.
463,I think that it is sort of a crap shoot. I'm not really sure what to think or do given the media coverage and the strong opposing sides. It is hard to find a neutral opinion on the subject. I will make my decision on election day. 
464,"HIllary Clinton is the most qualified candidate for President in generations, and has the temperament, knowledge, and character to lead. Donald Trump is an ignorant, bigoted demagouge who is an existential threat to the Republic"
465,NA
466,I think Hillary is a horrible candidate but I beleieve out of the two major party candidates she wins by default because Doanld Trump isn't even remotely qualified 
467,I just feel that Clinton is the best choice. I think Trump is a radical and doesn't care about anyone but himself.
468,NA
469,"Hillary is regrettably business as usual.  Its not good. / DT on the other hand is such a nightmare, such an uninformed moron, such a charlatan and obvious fraud and liar, there is simply no choice.  "
470,"Donald Trump is not qualified to be President.  It is ridiculous and outrageous that he is even the Republican candidate.  Though I am not a particularly big fan of Hillary Clinton, she is definitely the more suitable candidate.  She represents a move towards more progress already made by President Obama."
471,"I believe the current presidential race is the biggest joke I have personally witnessed as an adult. I understand that anyone who fits the criteria can run for office, but the fact that Trump has gotten this far is appalling and makes me question the intelligence and sanity of the average American; as well as the lack of gumption to demand our ""democratic"" nation to listen to reason and stop this mockery. /  / As for Clinton...she's a seasoned politician. And I mean that in both a complimentary and insulting way. If and when she becomes our next president, nothing major will change for the average American. Some good, a decent amount of masked bad that we won't notice until it is too late for the public. /  / Then wash, rinse, repeat for the next president. #realist"
472,Both are dishonest.  Hillary is willing to say anything to get people to vote for her.  Trump lies about everything because he doesn't know very much.
473,i think trump will do better then she will
474,Hillary Clinton is a liar and a crook who is out for herself at the risk of Americans. She is money and power hungry and in league with current legislators and big business to keep the country as it is.  /  / Donald Trump is a man with a vision. His personal characteristics are not great but he is committed to doing what he believes in and is a patriot. I believe in his views on almost everything. Social Security. Medicare. Immigration. Trade. Terrorism and the military. 
475,"I support Hillary Clinton. I think that she will do well for America. /  / I think Donald Trump is a self-centered person only in it for himself. He is very much like a dictator (Hitler), He is verbally abusive, prejudiced, uninformed, sexist and cruel. I will take our country back years. He is also most likely to bring us to war with other nations and do something destructive for the US."
476,NA
477,"Hillary Clinton had one job. She had to make Donald Trump look dumb. For undecideds, it will matter less that he's a bully or a liar. She has issues with trust, too. What will scare them is how unprepared he is. Every chance she gets to point this out has the potential to add points. Unfortunately for Clinton, she didn't take many of them. While she pointed out that his ""cavalier attitude"" toward nuclear weapons was dangerous, time and again, she punted at opportunities to point out how ill-informed and unprepared Trump is. Instead, she preferred to argue his vague platform on its merits. For her, this wasn't damaging, but it didn't move the needle in her favor."
478,I like Trump a little more than Hilary Clinton.  I feel like Hilary doesn't care about the middle class.
479,"I am not real impressed with The Donald right now. More and more insulting stuff about him keeps coming out. But he is, in my opinion, the lessor of 2 evils. I do not like anything about Hillary. She is pro abortion and I am a firm believer that is murder!!!"
480,"I do not believe that Donald Trump is qualified to make sane, rational decisions. I fully support Hilary Clinton and her politics. "
481,"I don't trust Clinton, but she is clearly the better politician and more tactful representative. In times of high cultural and international tension, that is the better bet for peace."
482,Not crazy about trump more against Hillary than for Trump.  Hillary seems more willing to do anything to further her polictical interest even if they are ethically questionable.  Donald Trump though he seems more like a loose cannon that seems a little frightening at least seems more transparent than Hillary.
483,"I don't like either of them. I think Trump is an incompetent, incoherent, violent manchild with a dozen sexual assaults to his name and who publically supports China's running over protesters with tanks. I think Hillary Clinton is very competent and knowledgeable at serving her own ends, has no real ideals or values, and did some things as secretary of state I wouldn't forgive anyone for involving bombings of civilians. She's still less likely to declare war over a tweet though so I suppose that makes her the lesser evil. "
484,"I feel like we got stuck with 2 horrible candidates.  They are both in it for themselves and do not have the best interest of the country in mind.  I will vote, but feel like I'm voting for the lesser of two evils."
485,"Trump has no experience in governance.  Clinton is a sociopathic, narcissistic, elitist, liar."
486,Donald Trump is a con man who doesn't care about America. He doesn't care about normal everyday citizens. If he did he wouldn't make anyone who he owes money have to sue him to get it. He is a joke and the Republican part deserves him. Hillary Clinton has been trying to help people her whole life. She knows policys and knows how to get things done. 
487,Hillary can NOT be trusted at all. She will ruin us
488,NA
489,I totally support Hillary because i think she is more capable to be a American president than Donald Trump and she will improve every aspect of American economy .She will think for people in USA and that is most important .
490,NA
491,"Clinton is a liar, a cheat, and is mentally unstable. I've heard awful reports about her acting out against her assistants, and she's not fit to be a president. She has no vision, she has never been a regular citizen, and she is not trustworthy. Trump has vision, is a strong leader, has been an average citizen before, and isn't afraid to offend people and won't cater to this social justice bullshit that every person my age is all about. "
492,"They both can't be trusted, but atleast Hillary has experience and is level headed."
493,Donald Trump has no political experience and is too conservative. Hillary Clinton has become the very establishment that she pretends to fight against.
494,"Donald Trump speaks in generalities, not backed up with facts. His proposals are not backed up with solid plans. Hillary Clinton would not be my first choice, but she would be much more able to handle the office with dignity and intelligence. Incidentally, I consider them both to be too old for the office. "
495,"I really like the views of Donald Trump, but his ideologies or way of doing things is disagreeable.  I do believe that trump might be using his personal fortune in order to contest with out the need for any donors , while Henry has to raise donations as she does not have the required funds."
496,"Donald Trump and the GOP are misogynistic, homo and transphobic, racist, xenophobic, among other things. I am primarily concerned, as a person who falls into marginalized categories and who keeps company with people who are most affected by the GOP's backwards way of thinking, with social issues over fiscal. I do not agree with Hillary on all issues, in fact, I disagree on many, but I believe that she will advance many things in the right direction, socially speaking."
497,"Donald Trump is not bought by Wall Street and donors so he owes nobody but the American people if he's elected president. I feel he's a person of character and integrity and will do what he said he'd do if he gets into office. I think he respect all races and gender.  /  / Hillary Clinton is a massive liar. She's untrustworthy and has committed, I believe, treason against the USA with her pay to play and secret server. I believe she sold access and information. She's the most corrupt person to ever run for the office of presidency."
498,NA
499,"I have a very personal disconnection from Hillary Clinton, as there are personal things she has done or not done that make me question her qualifications for becoming the POTUS.  However, the words, ideas, and actions of Donald Trump give me more doubts and fears."
500,no idea
501,"Neither major party candidate represents my interests in this election. Because of this, I have voted for a third party candidate. Unfortunately, in out current political system this is not going to have much of an impact."
502,My views are that I share a number of views as Hillary. I do not share the same views as Trump. I may agree a little with Trump but I feel much more agreeable towards Hillary.
503,Hilary is the best of two evils.  Our government needs a complete over haul
504,"Donald Trump attracts his own crowds. / Hillary Clinton has to use celebrities to get crowds. She's dishonest, and the Podesta email leaks prove beyond a shadow of a doubt she's a candidate that shouldn't be trusted. We can't even get an honest point of view from her. She says one thing and those emails say something else completely. /  / "
505,"I think Hillary is a terrible human being. I have always believed that she was deceptive and the more and more information that is coming out is not only disheartening but very scary. I think she is selfish and has always had this path in mind and that is why she stood by Bill's side- so she could ride his coat tails to ultimate power. /  / I think Trump needs to talk a lot less when he's angry. I personally believe he is very patriotic, but also very crude in his language and 'fly off the handle antics'. I believe he has genuine interest in making this country how it used to be. I support him mainly because he supports our troops and our police departments. To me our military/first responders deserve better than what Hillary would do for them. She has already proven herself to be incompetent at the cost of soldiers' lives. Enough is enough."
506,"Trump is a belligerent, idiotic, spoiled brat that never grew up. Feels entitled in every way. Will say anything if he thinks it's what you want to hear. Pathological liar with a fairly low IQ. Bombastic and cruel. /  / Hillary Clinton will not fix what needs to be fixed and will continue the policies of Obama and cause those Trump lovers to become even more hateful and divisive. She and her foundation have definitely done unethical things, but honestly probably less unethical than what Trump has done, which we don't even know the  tip of the iceberg yet. / Both choices in this election are absolutely abysmal, and it's becoming embarassing to identify as an American at times. "
507,"It's like watching a movie, the fact that this guy Donald Trump even says half the stuff he does, that any one would consider that ""ok"" to have someone that talks about grabbing women by the P__SY is seriously hard to believe.  Even worse is the hate monger of a possible vice president.  That guy, I can't even put my opinion in words, he hates way too many people to be a representative of what is ""good"" for people.  He scares me with his hate views on everything different from him... "
508,"Hillary is just a flat out power hungry lying criminal, always has been. She should be in jail, not running for leader of the free world. Trump is great at seeing what the lay of the land is and using that to be a popular candidate. I think his bluster is part of his negotiation skills, and if elected would back off of them to be diplomatic, he literally wrote the book on making deals. But Hillary and her criminal buddies have rigged the election, so she will win no matter what really happens with real votes."
509,I feel that Clinton is not fit to be president because she has committed multiple felonies. I can deal with Trump because he is a new face that does what he wants.
510,Both are not a fit to be president because they do not want to reverse damages done when the Constitution was overthrown a century ago and the United States of America lost it's sovereignty. 
511,I dont trust any of the candidates. None of the candidates are worthy of becoming president. 
512,"Trump is a racist, hes ignorant, hes only for himself. / Hilary is extremely informed and educated. She is very compassionate and for the people"
513,"Donald Trump is a horrible person, he is racist, sexist, violent, manipulative, and hot tempered.  He constantly accuses Hillary of being responsible and failing to perform tasks that she was not able to control (Bengahzi, Financial Crisis, and more). I can see it's a distraction, I wish others could too. /  / Secretary Clinton is experienced, she has clear ideas and is flexible enough to find ways to make them work through involving ideas from others. I believe that she will help this country along greatly if she is elected. I admire her strength and the patience that she has shown through these events."
514,Hillary is a proven criminal.  In favor of the American person you cannot vote for her

516,Hilary has been up front and open about things the media has brought up. Both candidates are now being investigated by the FBI which makes this election crazy and interesting. I am scared in Trump gets in. I recently moved to a new area and still have not found a job and have student loans that want to be paid. If he gets in my small next egg is gone and I might find myself homeless.
517,"Donald Trump is a racist man. His entire campaign is built off of fear and hatred. Hillary Clinton has her flaws, but she is qualified for the job, and expresses no racism as well as geninune desire to help our country move forward."
518,"I don't really have very strong feelings either way, but Trump is severely outclassed when it comes to political knowledge. Some could see this as a plus, but I'm not sure I do. Hillary already has a wealth of knowledge about how to run a country and has an extensive network of people to help her. Also, policy-wise, I tend to side with Hillary much more."
519,I think both of the main party candidates are sorry choices for such a large election but that I favor Hilary. 
520,"Hillary Clinton scares me, and she has been caught lying on important issues.  She also will say one thing to your face and something else behind your back. Plus, she is responsible for carelessly causing the death of soldiers in Benghazi.  Donald Trump is at least up-front about his views, he is not a politically correct weakling, and A LOT of companies go bankrupt; it doesn't mean he doesn't know how to handle money; clearly, he's a genius at it - the man is a billionaire!"
521,NA
522,"I THINK HILLARY CLINTON IS A CRIMINAL AND SHOULD BE IN JAIL.  SHE TALKS A BIG TALK BUT HASN'T MADE ANY REAL CHANGE DURING HER WHOLE POLITICAL CAREER.  FUTHERMORE, THE FACT THAT SHE AGREES WITH LATE TERM ABORTIONS DISGUSTS ME.  ALTHOUGH I THINK TRUMP IS A VILE HUMAN BEING, MY VOTE FOR HIM IS NOT FOR HIM, IT'S A VOTE AGAINST HILLARY."
523,"Hillary has more policies that I favor, though not all. She has decades of experience and knows what she's doing. However, her demeanor is somewhat cold and disconnected. She wouldn't be my first choice for President. But, Trump is a train wreck. He's ignorant, racist and elitist. He has no idea what he's doing. "
524,"I strongly believe in Donald Trump. While he may not be the best candidate on the planet, he is the better of the two evils. I never want to see Hiliary Clinton be elected into office."
525,"Hillary Clinton is experienced, honest and trustworthy who will definitely fulfill all the promises made to the citizens."
526,I feel very strong to the ideas of the article I just read.  I think that everything he wrote is right on the nail.  I also think that trump is a racist person and we need some one who is going to treat everyone the same 
527,Hilary Clinton has political experience while Donald Trump has money experience.
528,"Oh god Hillary Clinton, doesn't anyone remember the 1990a"
529,I don't like any of them.
530,Trump is rated as lying 72% of the time. Can you imagine how much he will lie as a president?
531,NA
532,"I am extremely pro-Hillary Clinton, a bias that is no doubt evident in my survey responses. I believe that it is time to have a woman in the White House, and that she is the right woman for that job, given her decades of experience in politics."
533,I think Donald Trump is interested in being President to satisfy his own ego and will not help the country move forward. Hillary Clinton has a past record of trying to make life better for people and I think the state of the country will be better off under her leadership.
534,"I think Hillary is the best chance we have to move progressive agendas forward or, at the very least, to maintain the progress we've made in terms of health care and civil rights issues. I think she gets a bad wrap on some level, that a picture has been painted of her that's not completely true. Donald Trump is a dangerous egomaniac. We do't know that his interests extend outside of himself. He's fanned the flames of racism and xenophobia in our country, all as a means of getting the attention and praise that his fragile ego requires. He has a thin skin and a temperament that in no way should be allowed to be the head of our country. He's a poor role model. "
535,"Clinton is certainly not a perfect candidate (I supported Bernie Sanders in the caucauses). But she is experienced, intelligence, and level-headed. Donald Trump is ignorant, dishonest, and has a hair trigger temper. He has abused every privilege he's every had to exploit and take advantage of others, and I fully expect he would abuse the powers of the presidency for his personal enrichment and to settle scores. And this is a man who flies into a rage when he is criticized. I expect that if he were president, he would violate the Constitution in order to seize more power. The worst candidate I've seen in my lifetime, and I'm pretty old. "
536,"I used to support Trump, but I feel he is basically a puppet of Russia. I am now going to vote for Clinton. I am hoping she reforms financial aid for students and improves Obamacare but I feel a Republican congress will block any efforts for reform."
537,"trump is a racist, liar, blowhard, will switch sides on the flip of a coin, money is his only true loyalty. / clinton is also a liar, less so then trump, corrupt politician, but will be loyal to her party line and not as horrible as trump / third party candiadates not known or enough data to know what they would do. / I would have voted for sanders and his platform address my concerned issues."
538,"I do not trust Hillary Clinton, and I believe she only cares about herself and being in power. I despise her, and I believe she is corrupt. I don't like everything Donald Trump does and says, but I think that he does truly care about America and he will change the government for the better."
539,"I will support Trump because he is the Republican candidate. I won't support Clinton because the Democratic platform includes the availability of abortion for any reason, which is the use of abortion as birth control."
540,I think they're both terrible but I think Donald Trump is an ignorant bigot with no interest in the needs of America but simply the will to win
541,I liked the campaign of Clinton it was very realistic and i felt like she cared about people not like Trump he's a self centred person and someone who only thinks about money.
542,NA
543,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is a committed and expert career politician with the interests of the common and unfortunate at her heart. Conversely, I think Donald Trump is an idiotic ivory tower demagogue who may very well be a psychopathic narcissist."
544,"Neither one of the candidates is an excellent choice for the President of the United States. But, Donald is simply, unfit to be president. Clinton is the better of the two."
545,"Although I do not like Donald Trump a great deal, the way Hillary Clinton handled Benghazi and her emails is a deal breaker.  I am veteran, so in my ex husband, and my daughter serves.  To me, national security and the security of my child while is she is serving this is country is the most important issue for me.  Unfortunately, Hillary Clinton has failed in showing that she is willing to do that by putting her interest before the American people, especially people who are willing to serve and die for this country."
546,"Hillary Clinton should be in jail and not able to run.  Anyone else would be for committing half of her crimes.  She has very poor judgement, and it has just come out today that she actually knew about pedophile Weiner long ago and did nothing to stop his crimes.  She has recently insulted African Americans by entertaining them with singers and celebrities instead of talking to them about issues.  Trump makes good sense about how to run the country."
547,I don't really support either of them
548,I think Donald will drive this country into the ground and the only clear choice at this point is Hilary.
549,"I feel that Donald Trump is all talk, I think he doesn't know what he's doing if he's the President. I'm really scare if he is going to be our next President. / As for Hillary Clinton, I feel like she genuinely does care about the people of America. She does have flaws, but I think she will be a better choice out of the two. Plus she does have a lot more experience than Trump."
550,They both are terrible
551,"I believe Hillary has spent her whole life fighting for equality for human rights, women and childrens rights. She is progressive and wants us all to move forward to gether for a more progressive integrated society where everyone from every culture can succeed and still be who they are. / I think Trump has spent his life coning people, frauding them with his University and his pyramid schemems. I think its ludicrous, that any one would think he could actually bring back jobs after he has soent his life sending them overseas, He has spent his life being a drain on America, he is a prime exapmle of the problems with the superior wealth in this countyr. Also he has no idea how govt works, he thinks he can be a dictator and just bully everyone. I woul;d be embarresed to have him as president, and I am positive he is in Cahots with Russia."
552,They are all crazy. Clinton is a better candidate based solely on political experience. Trump is a business man and that all. 
553,"I believe both major candidates to be corrupt. While Clinton, I believe, is dishonest and makes morally questionable choices, Trump, I believe displays abusive behavior. Nether behaviors are ideal to me in the leader of my country. Neither candidate makes me feel safe. I worry a great deal about the direction our nation is headed. Clinton fails to elicit trust amongst her own people, and Trump, I believe, will offend every other country on the planet. Yikes!"
554,NA
555,"It's like trying to decide if you would rather be shot or given the electric chair. Neither candidate is worthy of the job and it's amazing they are the options we have for the next president. I don't feel comfortable with either in charge, but with Trump getting elected it would certainly be getting away from the same old, same old people in government."
556,"I don't particularly like Hillary Clinton but at least she has shown to be intelligent and capable to make the decisions. Hopefully if she is elected, she will not favor her sponsors and go against what is right for the American people. I agree with her on many things such as abortion, gun reform etc. but I worry she might make the wrong decisions if it is asked of her by her sponsors.  /  / I thought Donald Trump running would be seen as a joke and I am shocked he made it this far. I do think it should send a message to politicians that there is a great disconnect between them and the American people if they are willing to go with this candidate because he is perceived as an outsider. All in all, I'm not sure Trump would be the worst president but I am greatly concerned about his volatile temper and his lack of tact. "
557,NA
558,"The positives for Trump is his incompetence and the belligerent nature that would likely not make him such a pawn of his political party, however these are also all negatives. Hillary does not put forward an image that can be trusted and does not seem to have a cool enough head to not let others, like Trump not get under her skin. Her use of government office to advance her monetary gain is again deplorable as well as her opaque nature. Having another clinton is symptomatic of a dynasty as well."
559,"I feel like Donald Trump will take away rights that lgbt people have recently gained. He's too unstable to make governmental decisions. Hillary, while maybe a little questionable, still has america's best interest at heart. "
560,"I believe at this point in time, HIllary Clinton has already shown us in many parts the maximum contribution she'll make to the American people. While Donald Trump is fresh with new ideas. Which is what America needs. That's what helps us grow better and stronger. New representation and ideas. HIllary whether a continuation of Barrack Obama or Bill Clinton to me doesn't represent growth and new directions."
561,I feel they both are corrupt
562,"If Clinton is elected, there will be no more America.  She has already sold us out to the Saudis and they will be looking to collect. I don't know how she can even be allowed to run, given her criminal record. Trump will lower taxes for everyone.  He will bring jobs back to America, and he will not allow the Muslim Brotherhood to make America a Caliphate with Sharia Law. Which is what I know Clinton will do.  We cannot support any more freeloading immigrants. The Middle Class will disappear entirely from having to support these people, many of whom are criminals. I don't understand why or how people can't see this! Are there that many morons in this country who vote on emotion only and never bother to look up the facts??"
563,"I cannot even express how utterly evil and beguiling Hillary would be if elected. Honestly, I have no idea why the heck Trump even ran. It seems more of a passing interest to him, because he has no political background nor experience. I feel we Americans are over a barrel on this one, but I feel Trump would be the better choice. Most people have no idea what Hillary is really like. This country will fall rapidly. I'm not sure it matters who votes for who, because I believe that the election is fixed. I also am inclined to believe that Obama will declare an emergency on or after November 8th and declare he cannot leave his position until a solution can be arrived at. Wouldn't surprise me in the least. "
564,I thin Hillary stands for more of the same things I do in terms of freedoms of choice. But I side with Trump on needing to fix the school system. I ignore all slander and just look at what they stand for hopefully it turns out true.
565,"Trump and Hillary both terrify me.  I can't imagine either of them being competent enough to be the president.  At this point, because I don't live in a swing state (and my state will definitely go Trump) I will be voting for a third party to help them get the 5 percent needed to receive government funding on the next ticket.  Because I live in a Trump state, I feel I have very little influence on this election.  Voting third party is the only way that I can vote that might actually make a difference.  I pray that we have better candidates next time around. "
566,"Donald Trump is clearly disrespectful of women, minorities, and people from other countries. He is neither intelligent enough or mature enough to handle the responsibility of being president. Hillary Clinton is competent and qualified to be president."
567,"I like Donald Trump because of his incentives.  Any notion that he is in this for business dealings is complete garbage, because all of the time/money/energy he has donated could not possibly give that large of a personal return.  I also think Hillary Clinton is completely corrupt and is pulling a quick one on the American people."
568,"I feel like Donald Trump is more in it for himself.  He wants to become president as a signal of power and success but not necessarily equipped to run a country.  He has the country's best interest in mind but does not consider consequences in his actions, such as bombing ISIS.  While I agree Clinton cannot be fully trusted, she has an entire career in politics."
569,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is only looking out for the poor and the extremely wealthy.... she doesn't care at all for the middle class. The working class is what keeps the majority of this country together and if all you are doing is hurting them, then you are hurting the country as well. This is why Donald Trump will make a better president. He understands the need for the middle class to be treated fairly, not as a means for the poor to live comfortably off the system. /  / Trump's ideals also align more with mine than Clinton's does when it comes to issues of national security, immigration, and patriotism."
570,NA
571,"I think they are both non-ideal candidates, but they individually have beneficial tactics towards improving our country. I am leaning towards Donald because I think he is aggressive enough to make improvements if he will think."
572,i feel like Trump is the only way to get this country back to the original ideas.
573,While Trump isn't the best out there. At least he isn't a criminal. Hopefully he can surround himself with people that hold some of his beliefs and we can get our country back on track.
574,"The concern I have with Donald Trump is that he is a loose cannon. He says things just to get a response from the people he is entertaining. While I am sure that any figurehead could run the country with the proper advisers, I do not feel that Trump will pick the right people. I am voting for Hillary Clinton because I feel that she is the best qualified of all the individuals in the running, that actually have a chance of winning. I still do not have 100% confidence in her, but I make the choices based on what I am given."
575,"Being a candidate of change, if Trump can succeed in just some of his ideas we will be much better off. Being a status quo and paid for by donors plus lying whenever her mouth moves, Hillary Clinton cannot be trusted to do anything good for the citizens of the USA. "
576,"Donald Trump may be a jerk, but Hilary Clinton will be the end of us. If Hilary is elected, we will have Satan and her rapist husband, ol' Bill Clinton as the first family of our country. Seriously, BILL CLINTON y'all. The guy who started America down this terrible path so many years ago."
577,"Hillary Clinton is a liar and doesn't know how to run a country. She can't even keep her husband under control. I have no respect for her. Donald Trump is a liar and is not very intelligent; however, he has owned and operated several successful companies. I feel that you should never be the smartest person in the room. A smart person will surround him/herself with smarter people to get something done. Donald Trump has shown he has able to put the right people in the right places to become successful and he will do that in his presidency."
578,I believe Donald Trump can be trusted to do what he says.  HIllary has a track record of being untruthful and I think this country definitely needs a change for the better in regards to its present state.
579,"Trump is grossly unqualified for president. He is volatile, self-centered, and a racist bigot. Hillary has had a questionable past, but in the race against Trump, is by far the best choice for our nation at this time."
580,"Clinton is more qualified and capable to become president whereas Trump is more of a businessman, not confident about his skills to run a country. "
581,"I am definitely pro-Trump, for many different reasons. It is difficult for me to see how anyone would vote for Hillary, someone who is literally a criminal under FBI investigation. I think Trump has our country's best interests at heart and we should vote for a businessman rather than another corrupt politician who will probably get us into war with Russia. Trump, on the other hand, said he would try to cooperate with Putin. If there wasn't reason enough to vote for him already, that seals the deal."
582,"I feel that there are pros and cons to each candidate.  To me, there is not a clear ""right choice"", which is concerning.  I'm nervous regardless of who is elected president."
583,I am extremely worried about either candidate becoming president.  Although I do agree with a lot of what Donald Trump says I am afraid of what he will do to the relationships we have with other countries.  I do not trust Hillary Clinton at all. 
584,Trump is too aggressive and offensive. Hilary is too influenced. 
585,"I haven't been following the election fully but from my understanding a lot of people like me are afraid for Trump to run this country and for that reason I am leaning towards Hillary Clinton, since i believe she generally cares more about the underrepresented. Trump's views are just not similar to mine, although a lot of people feel what he is saying makes sense, I think once he would be elected, certain groups in America would just go downhill. "
586,I feel Hillary is more qualified for the job than Donald Trump.  I do not like either candidate. 
587,"In a perfect world, neither of these candidates would end up as our president, but I feel we must vote for the lesser of two evils. Donald Trump is a sexist, homophobic, racist businessman who has no experience in the political field and only gives like-minded people the idea that it's okay to be so hateful. Hillary Clinton is not my ideal candidate because I question how much we can trust her, but she has extensive experience in the political arena."
588,"Trump is speaking what is on his mind without decorating or ""filtering"" his words or promises which makes me feel comfortable voting for him and gives me the impression that he is honest. Hillary chooses her each and every word when she talks which not makes me feel that she means exactly/and or feels what she is saying!"
589,I support Donald trump
590,"This election feels very much like the battle between two evils. I have major issues with the way Donald Trump comports himself, with his words and the hateful feelings he stirs up. On the other hand, I don't have any trust at all in Hillary Clinton, and am just slightly less in favor of her way of doing things. I wish I was voting for someone I believe in, but instead like many people I know am stuck voting against the person I fear most."
591,"Trump is not a career politician. He does not have to be bought. I like that. I like that he wants illegals to enter our country legally. He is against abortion. He says what he wants to say whether it is politically correct or not. I am very blunt as well. /  / Clinton is a career politician who has made decisions and supported agendas that I do not agree with. Her support of her husband (as a woman myself) appalls me. There is too much smoke (Wikileaks, emails, deaths, Benghazi, Qatar, Laura Silsby) for there not to be fire somewhere."
592,Donald Trump is a sociopath.  Hillary Clinton has been doing things she had to do for 24 years to become the first female President. She's done far fewer negative things than the males who've been running for President for the past 24 years.  
593,"Hillary Clinton certainly has her flaws but bottom line is she knows politics, she has experienced politics. I feel she would be able to work together with the rest of the government to make good decisions for the country.  /  / Donald trump has no idea what he is getting into and would not at all be able to handle the job. "
594,Trump tells it like it is and Clinton lies.  I'll take Trump over Clinton every single day.
595,NA
596,"Out of hundreds, if not thousands, of possibilities these two are what we have to choose from. At first, I really enjoyed the outlier aspect of Trump, especially when juxtaposed with Sanders. What a wakeup call that would have been. Regardless this is our choice.  /  / 1) a hothead, ignorant of basic facts, thin skinned, racist, and narcissist  / or / 2) the typical politician with a poor history of scandal, but experience in government. "
597,"I am excited at the prospect of finally having a female president. I am Liberal, and Hillary Clinton's current viewpoints mirror many of my own. Donald Trump concerns me, immensely. "
598,"Trump is batshit crazy, but has certain rhetoric skills that could get him elected. That is terrifing. Clinton is a decent candidate, but also part of the machine. The U.S. first woman president would be great, but much of the rest of the world is ahead on that one. I do not consider the rest very much even if I agree with what they say. "
599,"I wish Bernie Sanders was running instead. I am not much of a Republican, and do not like Donald Trump or his views. I also do not want Clinton president, but I like her views a bit more and also the democratic views."
600,no comment
601,I think that both candidates are profoundly flawed. Trump is dangerous for our democracy because he does not understand it and is willing to run roughshod over our rules and norms. Clinton is a Nixonian candidate who can not help but embroil herself in scandal after scandal after scandal. 
602,"I do not think Trump has the knowledge, experience or cultural sensitivity to be president. I am not overly favorable towards Clinton, but I feel she is more qualified than Trump."
603,"Neither is the best representative for their party, but I'm not angrily for or against either one. I try to gather all information to make the best decision I can. It bothers me when people blindly support a candidate based on biased information. "
604,"Hillary is a dishonest crook who is the beneficiary of nepotism and a bought and paid for candidate and warmonger who has been in politics for decades and has accomplished almost nothing of note.  /  / Trump is an honest crook who is the beneficiary of nepotism and has his own money and has actually accomplished things, though he is a shameless populist who has no real intention of following through on campaign promises. /  / Gary Johnson is a libertarian and probably the most decent candidate available. /  / Jill Stein seems kooky."
605,"Neither candidate is very good.   Donald Trump is very inexperienced, a hot head, and  says anything that is on his mind, for better or worse.  Hillary Clintion is a potential security threat to our country, depending on what FBI finds. "
606,"As an educated person, I cannot suppor Trump who does not seem to have well-grounded program and who speaks/acts like a 5-year old. He might be a businesman (not very successful though) but it is not enough to run the country because the conuntry is not a business - it is more complex. / Hillary Clinton is not perfect maybe but her education and experience seem to fit the presidential position much better. "
607,"I don't think much of either one of them. Hillary seems very establishment, while Donald can't seem to keep his mouth shut. That said, I feel like Donald is the better choice simply for being something different. "
608,i perfer trump because he wants to protect are gun rights and babies i feel as hillary is going to sell are country and we wont live in a  land of freedom
609,I Think Donald trump will keep us safer than Hillary will cause he cares about the average American and all Hillary will do is try to hide her wrongdoings from the American people.
610,"i'm not especially crazy about hillary's corporate ties, but that's par for the course for politicians. trump is a dangerous lunatic. better a mediocre status quo than an incompetent psychopath in office"
611,"no view at all they both aren't the best choices hillary is the better of 2 evils, donald trump would make a horrific president, hillary will be tolerable but not the best choice. "
612,"Donald Trump has expressed thoughts of hate and inequality for people who are not fortunate like himself. If you're well off, Donald wants to look out for you but he has nothing to offer people like me. Hillary, on the other hand, offers hope for a change in the right direction."
613,"They are both pretty horrible. I think Trump is a joke and has been his whole life, smoke and mirrors. And I do think Clinton is corrupt and i don't trust her. "
614,"There is not much to choose from this election. We have a liar and a crook, which is Clinton, then on the other hand, we have an egoistical woman hater that is rich. I predict that this election will be the closest in the history of elections. People do not know what to believe. Candidates have changed their views and opinions of current issues and we do not know what to believe. Opinions are like a**holes we all have one. "
615,donal trump is a narcissist / hillary clinton is a career politician
616,"I think this election is about picking the worse of the two evils. As a minority and a female, I am unsure of how anyone in my shoes could support Donald Trump."
617,"Hillary clinton is a pathological liar, a pedofile defender, a rapist of people and the land and our country. Trump is an ugly businessman but at least he tells it straight. Clinton lies through her teeth nonstop with a fake smile plastered on her face and is of ill health. She might not even be physically fit for president. The FBI needs to arrest her. I hope trump wins so he can throw her in jail."
618,I feel that trump is to harsh and his ideas of getting rid of health care and lowering taxes on the rich will make things much worse. He will be a very bad choice. Hillary will keep the health care and help improve it and run things much better.
619,I believe Donald Trump is a danger not only to the United States but the entire civilized world. He would implement policies that would divide and hurt the people of many nations. He is naive to world affairs and ignorant to public policies.  Hillary Clinton understand the world clearer and she is informed. She has traveled the world and represented the United States with honor. She is respected the all over the world. Her policies would advance our country forward not backwards. 
620,Donald trump would cause us to move back in time fifty years in regards to equality. I miss Bernie sanders. We're screed either way for the next four years.
621,"Donald Trump is in the race solely to advance himself. His platforms are amorphous enough that no one can say what he would actually do once elected, although it seems that some of his most horrendous goals might be the ones we can be most sure of (deportation of 12 million+ undocumented immigrants, repealing the ACA, etc...). A vote for Trump is a vote for chaos. /  / Hillary Clinton has been involved in politics for so much of her life that she clearly knows how to get things done. Although I don't agree with her on many issues, as she is much closer to a neo-Conservative than a progressive when it comes to foreign policy, her stances on women's rights and other important progressive topics make her the only option this election cycle."
622,"I don't like either one of the candidates. I don't agree with Hillary's policies. I think she is a politician. I agree with a lot of Donald Trump policies, but I think his moral character is very bad and not a good example for society."
623,"Donald Trump is not at all qualified to be president and can not be elected. Hillary is not a better choice, she is a system politician, but I think she would do a far better job than Trump would. Jill Stein is crazy and way too idealistic. Gary Johnson is a sympathetic character, but he prescribes to one too many wacky ideas."
624,"Both of the main candidates are completely unacceptable and unsupportable. I am HORRIFIED by both. When forced to choose between the two I choose Trump because of Hillary's neoconservative foreign policy approach and support, HRC terrifies me with her bellicose and aggressive foreign policy stances. Syria could lead to WW3 with HRC, and she could easily get us in to a war with Russia. This forces me to support Trump when forced to choose between the 2. Thankfully I can vote for Jill Stein. I simply can not support either of the other 2."
625,Donald trump is a threat and so is Hilary Clinton.
626,"Trump is a nut job, an Hillary is a liar"
627,"They are both terrible candidates, but picking one is based on the lesser of two evils. I believe Clinton will win, regardless of how many people will vote for Trump. Trump seems like the lesser of two evils, I feel like Clinton is always caught in a lie, she shouldn't be trusted. Also, many other countries we deal with look down on women, and having a woman as our countries leader might make it very challenging for us, and they might not take us seriously. "
628,"Using caution with Hilary.  Trump is a fool at times, but more realistic.  "
629,"I think they are both less then stellar, Hilary is a liar and Trump a bigot. "
630,I think it is an abomination that these are the two best candidates for the presidency of the United States of America. I cannot think of two worse candidates for the presidency in my lifetime. I wish we could hit the reset button two years ago and promote a candidate who I would deem worthy of leading the nation.
631,"Clinton is a liar. For what she has done in office as Sec of State, Senator, she should be in jail not running for the presidency. Trump is a jackass. "
632,"HIllary Clinton is ""more of the same""  in that we will elect a politician who will attempt to push her agenda and will have some successes and some failures in doing so. It's not what I particularly want in Government but it continues the status quo without major upset to the financial markets or world stage. /  / Donald Trump is a self-obsessed, dangerous narcissist. There is little in his message which appeals beyond the basest of human nature and he would be dangerous to this or any other society. Yes, I can see the appeal of going for ""something different"" but frankly a country with a leader who looks down on women, wants to purge the country of minorities and wants to funnel more money to the rich is not the kind of change anyone should desire. "
633,"I think Hillary Clinton is the better choice simply because Donald Trump doesn't really even have a plan to address the problems of the country. Furthermore, Donald Trump is a very wild character that is not knowledgeable of the government and is just not fit to be the president. Hillary Clinton on the other hand has beyond the necessary experience in public service, lays out her plans, and is a stable person fit for service as the president."
634,"Unfortunately, this election is truly about the lesser of two evils, of which I believe Clinton is. She does have extensive and valuable experience in politicals, in particular foreign relations, and that is absolutely critical to the nation's needs right now. Although Trump alleges he has the benefit of being an ""outsider"", he's really not - as far as the wealth and prestige he boasts - and his personality and temperament are far too volatile. He would be far more reactionary & impulsive, whereas Clinton would make a more careful assessment and actually listen to her advisors before making a decision. THAT distinction is what ultimately makes me choose Clinton."
635,"I really don't agree with either. But, if I had to choose, it would be Hilary. I don't agree with everything she says and find certain things about her questionable. But, Donald Trump, I truly believe would be the downfall of the country. I honestly wouldn't even want to stay here with him as president. I think the hate crimes would increase and people would get away with a lot of it."
636,"Donald trup competative, sincear but little arogant eprson. some of their policies might be not acceptable."
637,the media bias against donald trump makes me like him more. The same media never asks hillary about emails donna brazile leaking questions or the spirit cooking deal.
638,The two main party candidates are both terrible and there is no good answers between either of them. I will be voting for Gary Johnson who represents more of what I believe in.
639,"I have no attachment to Hillary Clinton, but agree with Miles, that at least with her I can trust that she has good intentions and positive intent for our country, with the actual experience to try. Trump, on the other hand, is hot-headed and while I do believe he truly wants to ""make America great again,"" I don't think he has the traits, knowledge, or experience to. I also don't believe he has his pulse on a lot of America in what he would consider being great again. I will never be able to support a candidate who threatens to put their opponent in jail if they win. That is just a crazy person with crazy ideas."
640,"Donald Trump's views could set us back decades. He is buddy buddy with the KKK and Putin, says and does degrading things against women, and has driven many of his companies into bankruptcy. It makes one wonder what he would do to America as president. On the other hand, Hillary Clinton has experience in the White House and other government roles. She understands how to interact with others as an adult. While both candidates have sketchy backgrounds, Hillary Clinton seems to be the lesser of two evils. "
641,I think Hilary Clinton is polished and experienced. This will make her transition to the position as president seamless. I think not much will change under her presidency. I think Donald Trump is unpredictable and self centered. I think his transition to the position of president will be turbulent and a lot will change under his command. 
642,"To be honest, I hate them both and would not trust either of them. That being said, I think Hillary Clinton is SLIGHTLY better."
643,I feel that Hilary Clinton does not qualify to be our next president because of her illegal actions.  Donald Trump is not much of a better candidate but I feel that he has the nations security as his top priority far more than Clinton does.
644,Hillary is corrupt and we are in trouble if she becomes president. /  / Trump will make a great president. He has my vote.
645,HILARY IS A CRIMINAL. TRUMP ISNT RIGHT TO BE PRESIDENT EITHER BUT AT LEAST HE DOESNT HAVE THE RECORD HILARY DOES. 
646,"I think that Donald Trump is too outspoken and isn't afraid to speak his mind. That may be a good thing, but could also create more problems. I don't have many thoughts on Hillary, I think she is a liar and is keeping secrets."
647," I believe that Trump will pretty much take this country in the way it needs to go to correct what is wrong with it. he is not perfect, but he is what we need to regain our position economically and diplomatically. I think Clinton will just continue to follow the lead of the previous administration in taking the country in the wrong direction."
648,"I think that both candidates are terrible options for president. I abhor the idea that I must vote for one or the other and I feel that democracy has failed us in that many citizens feel, and truthfully so, that there are only two options for presidential candidate. "
649,I think both primary party candidates are terrible. I voted third party and I hope others do as well.
650,I don't believe either candidate is too trust worthy. I don't believe Donald Trump as enough personal experience for the job. America is not a business.
651,I think hillary is evil and i will vote for anyone running against her.
652,I support Trump based on his economic policies. Social issues for not matter to me.
653,I believe neither of them have the middle class best inest in mind.  No one cares what the average joe thinks they care about those withbillions of dollars.  Hillary is just another corrupt politician and can not be trusted at all.  Trump is the lesser of two evils and he may be what we need to shake up this corrupt government and finally make some meaningful changes ithis country.  Trump may totally screw things up but I think even that would be better than staying on the current course.  
654,"I have the same views as the author of the article, Supreme Court nominees is a big concern of mine. stronger border controls, stopping drugs and criminal illegals. The left wants open borders. Jobs leaving country. Threats of terrorists. Stronger police force having the tools to do their jobs. better infrastructure, / lots of issues not being addressed by current politicians. "
655,NA
656,"As a female who has been sexually assaulted, I will not vote for a woman who is married to a man who has committed a sexual assault. As a military veteran, who had a very high security clearance and access to many things, I will note vote for a woman who cannot understand why you don't tote your email server home and store it in your closet. And I will not vote for a woman, who....*worse* lied about it. We have the proof of her stating those lies on Youtube. Not articles, where the author may be giving their opinion and twisting -- but videos showing her lying right to whomever asked her about it.  I can't vote for someone like that. Ever.  /  / Trump is embarrassing. I don't like him very much, but I don't despise him in the same way I do Hilary (for the above 2 things AND many more things). But as a vet, I cannot go without voting. I come from a military family that goes many, many generations back, and I respect what my ancestors did to get us where we are today.  /  / So, I'll be voting for Trump reluctantly.  /  / Frankly, I'm disappointed (more than any election ever) by both candidates."
657,"Trump has outdated and bigoted views. He also degrades women. Hilary isn't great either, but just the better of two evils."
658,"Donald trump represents change,  He is  good businessman and this country needs someone to run it like a business.  Hillary represents the corrupt establishment. Based on past actions she cannot be trusted."
659,"Hillary Clinton has the experience in diplomacy and legislation to do the best job.  She respects women and minorities.  She believes in background checks before purchase of guns. / Trump is the opposite.  He is a misogynist with no respect for women.  He wants to deport as many people as possible.  He is a failure in business.  He's loud and abrasive with NO diplomatic skills.  He has never written a law in his life.  Possibly the worst part is his friendship with Vladimir Putin.  This is the first time that a Presidential candidate has been endorsed by the KKK, the KGB and white supremacists."
660,"Concerning these two candidates, I feel that the Donald Trump campaign has been an embarrassing, yet enlightening window into  the American electorate. Hillary, while being an extremely unpopular candidate, has shown with  her relative popularity to Trump shows just how divided this country is at this moment. With nearly 40% of voters surveying in favor of  each major candidate, it seems that in this election most people are unhappy with the choice pushed up by their party's primaries, but continued willingness to ""hold their noses"" this Tuesday.  "
661,Trump and Clinton are equally awful. 
662,"I believe Hilary Clinton is best for our country.Her views on everything are ideal.Not to mention the supporters are ideal.Donald Trump is a good business man,but he is not presidential.Most of his views are not ideal,and lot of his supporters are raciest.I think the country could go a little backwards with him."
663,"I'm not a fan of either candidate in terms of having to choose a president for the election. However, I have always had a moderate amount of respect for Hillary Clinton, and I've always been on the democratic side of the government. I think Hillary has her nose buried in secrets and lies, but that deep down she means well. I see her as a much more capable candidate for presidency, and much more of a role model for our children. /  / Trump, I see as a narcissistic, self-obsessed attention seeker. I don't trust that he's out for anyone but himself. People talk about how he's shaking things up and telling the truth, but I'm quite sure he's just saying whatever it takes to get ahead in the polls. I don't trust Trump at all, whereas Clinton I still have a moderate amount of trust that she will lead our country as fairly as possible."
664,"I am leaning donal trump, but not because of him but because i want to see the republican party win, change it up this year.  i do not like hillary clinto, she is not feeling good and just seems like a cunt.  donald trump is all over the fucking place, but he does come off more honest and sincere than hillary.  we are doomed, i just hope its not just them making decisions, and it is the group of whole making choices for america."
665,"I don't like either, but the danger Clinton poses to our country far outweighs the problems that Trump represents.  Normally I refuse to ""vote for the lesser of two evils"" but we literally cannot afford Clinton in office. Our budget can't afford it, our national security can't afford it, and our Constitution cannot afford it."
666,"I believe that Hilary Clinton is going to be another Obama, and do nothing but continue to destroy our country. Whereas Trump has a lot of great stances and ideas, that if followed through could really make America great again."
667,"I agree with the article I read. I think Donald Trump is in the election for himself, not for the bettering of the country. It's a huge joke that someone as rude and uncultured as him is in the election. I do think that Hillary Clinton has done somethings that she shouldnt have, but at least she ACCEPTS RESPONSIBILITY and moves forward. "
668,"I can't say I completely trust Donald Trump; he is, after all, running for political office.  That in itself requires a certain amount of wheeling and dealing.  But he does have a lot of good ideas.  Whether he'll be able to implement them, I can't say for sure, but he's our best shot. /  / However, I absolutely wouldn't trust Clinton as far as I could throw her.  There are mountains of evidence showing that if she became president, the country would essentially be controlled by George Soros and every other globalist.  "
669,I think both candidates have their strengths and weaknesses. I think both bring something to the table that the other does not. Either way...this election has to be one of the worst elections of all times. 
670,"Trump is deceitful, bombastic, egocentric, and rude. He has no qualifications to serve in any public office, much less president, and he has lied about his own avenues for making and keeping money himself and away from people that earn it. /  / Hillary has been under the microscope for 30+ years. She has given her career and life's work to the betterments of women, children, and communities that are underserved. There is no denying that. That is the kind of president I want."
671,not a fan of either
672,"I think that Donald Trump leads an unexamined and angry life, and has no understanding of how the world works or what he is doing. I think that Hilary is also not in tune with the world but she leans more in my direction. "
673,I hate that only the two main parties get attention. I would like to know more about the other five options. 
674,I rather have someone with some sort of experience in office rather than a hot head like TRUMP
675,"Donald Trump is a liar, a racist, a sexist, and all around despicable human being.  Hillary Clinton, while certainly no saint herself, I believe is capable of effectively running this country."
676,I can't stand Clinton.  I don't like Trump much more.  However he is a slightly better choice.  I don't think the country can take four more years of someone who thinks like Obama. I think Obama care is this worse thing going on in this country. Clinton supports this.  So my only choice is Trump as sad as that is.
677,I feel both candidates are not favorable representations of the best that America has to offer butI seldom believe in the ability of the government to positively impact my quality of living. Especially on an individual level of presidential leadership. There is so much red tape and beurocracy  it's challenging for anyone to truly leave a lasting impact of positive change in spite of the best of intentions. 
678,"I am very pro Hillary Clinton and very anti Donald Trump. I believe Hillary will do her best, and has done her best for 30 years, to serve our country well and that she has the ability to succeed."
679,"My faith in the election system was never very high, but after this election, I have little to no faith.  I do not know how these two even became the nominees for their respective parties.  It seems in hindsight that there were much better choices."
680,"As a woman, I think Donald Trump is evil. As a mother of a daughter there is no way I could vote for a man with such deplorable views of women. I don't like Hillary Clinton as a person. i think she tries too hard to convince people that she's a feminist. She tries to portray this sisterhood solidarity, but it doesn't ring true. However I will vote for her because I believe she is the better choice."
681,Im more toward hillary on the election. I was a bernie supporter. For a while i was jill stien but i may vote hilary cause the election is to close.
682,"I can't say I support Hillary enough to put a yard sign in my yard, but I prefer her temperament and views on social issues over Donald Trump's. Donald is too volatile, he has a very limited grasp on important issues, and he's only in it for himself. "
683,"I'm sorry, I'm really not that informed about either one of the candidates.  Having a woman for president scares me, though she may be more empathetic.  Donald Trump just plain scares me!"
684,I think Hillary Clinton is a criminal based on the laws she has broken. I also believe that the amount of money she takes from the rich as well as other countries cannot be ignored as it will clearly effect her presidency.  /  / I think Donal Trump is a flawed human but one whose best interests are in the countries progress.  His business interests can only be helped by the country getting better and that is what he can and given the chance may do.  
685,Trump is an arrogant prick who only cares about his image and himself. Clinton is a wishy washy person who was embarrassed by her husband years ago and did not divorce her husband for the wrong reasons. They are both embarrassing to this country but Clinton just a little less.
686,I feel like Clinton is the perverbial lesser of two evils.
687,"I do not like Trump's attitude towards women, immigrants, and the disabled and I wish he would talk more about his policies and plans for the country. I feel I am more familiar with what Clinton has planned for the country."
688,"I think Donald Trump is completely outrageous, whereas Hillary, though equally bad, is more of a lying politician and you know what you get with her at least. I don't like the fact that she has Wall Street in her pocket, and don't think she will do much to help lower class people and people of color in this country, so things will pretty much stay as is. With Donald Trump, I firmly believe he will start World War III and we will have a KKK uprising on our hands. But with both candidates I believe that we will have a continued genocide of people of color, Donald Trump is just more obvious about how he feels about things and his concern for his own self interest about all else."
689,"I am not excited about either candidate.  They both scare me but in different ways.  However, looking at the big picture and the future with the Supreme Court in question, my decision leaned toward Trump."
690,I think that both Clinton and Trump do not represent the American people very well. That neither one is good enough to represent America and the American people. This whole campaign has been a circus. 
691,"Donald Trump is an arrogant ass, who is in this purely for power, and Clinton is a scheming witch who is only slightly better."
692,I think Hilary is a crook and Donald is not a quality human being.
693,"I like the calm composure of Clinton. I like that she has  knowledge about what she talks about. She is firm on what she stands for. I don't like when Trump talks about issues and I see unsure answers, lack of knowledge and his temperament."
694,"i believe donald trump does not care about anyone but himself. i believe he will have the untied states in a war, i believe he will be a great threat to the working class, i believe he will be impossible to work with.  / i believe hillary clinton will fight for the working class, will fight for healthcare , womans rights, a higher minimum wage, and eduction. i believe the majority of people who are voting for trump are uneducated. "
695,They are all horrible. Its very upsetting that this is the best we have to offer. I wish Rand Paul were the Republican nominee.
696,I feel like Hilary is a criminal and getting away from everything.She is also punting our country at risk.If the average person did what she has we would all be in prison.SO WHY IS SHE STILL OUT?? Trump cant be bought and people are afraid of what he will do.They may not like it but its what we need.We need someone who is for the people and someone who will get our country back.
697,Donald Trump has a very narrow worldview and is sophomoric in his demeanor and understanding of issues. He is not qualified for the office of presidency. Hillary Clinton on the other hand is vastly more experienced and intelligent. She is shown to be untrustworthy but her qualifications far outweigh Trump's.
698,"Hillary is a lying corporate puppet. Trump is an untrustworthy, arrogant child."
699,"Would be afraid to have Donald Trump as president, very pro Hilary "
700,Donald Trump understands the direction America is going and is striving to make changes before our countries values completely diminish. He is not a politician and only wants to the best for America. 
701,"Donald Trump disgusts me but I do respect him for being honest. His views on women, minorities, and the fact that he grew up a New Yorker with a silver spoon in his mouth lets me know he has no understanding of what it is to work hard and get things from the mud. Honestly it angers me when people talk about patriotism and being an American when half of this country have come from families who emigrated here from other countries and emigrated illegally but sought a better life. It is funny to me that people forget how Italians, Irish, and Jews were treated coming to this country. Its funny to me how we allow Cubans to escape poverty and seek freedom yet we turn the ""Black"" Haitians back to the country who still this day have not seen a red cent of that Haitian Earthquake Aide money. Lets funny people forget that these ""Mexicans"" haven been in the lower southwest and southeast of the United States before these states were apart of the United States. Sure borders have to be protected but if we are going to protect them they need to be protected them from everyone. It also angers me how stupid people are, allowing the rich divide and conquer. Instead of black, versus white, or any other color it should be us rich versus the poor that is when true change will come. And Hilary is no picker either. She gets on my nerves to with her stiff self. Never trust a woman who lacks emotion. But maybe that is something she learned from working with men. She's a liar like the rest of the politicians in bed with these corporations whom mean no actual good to the American people. Honestly, Bernie Sanders was really our one true hope and the brainless idiots messed it all up for us. Meanwhile, I've been applying for jobs overseas. America is full of courpt, self loathing, greedy, capitalists idiots."
702,"Candidates whom ever wins the president election is not the matter, but doing something meaningful to all class of the people."
703,"Trump is a self-serving, arrogant, sexist anachronism with no experience in politics. Clinton is an experienced, capable, competent person who campaigns for social policies that increase fairness and individual rights. "
704,"I favor Clinton over Trump, because I believe she has our best interests at heart. I am not a huge fan of her, but I prefer her over Trump by a long shot. Trump is just a mess. He's a terrible politician, his words are meaningless, and he's little more than an overgrown toddler throwing a tantrum."
705,"I feel like this year more than in past elections, we are truly voting for the lesser of two evils.  Neither candidate is ever perfect, but this election seems to be filled with so much controversy and immorality that I feel like I'm watching a reality tv show on MTV.  I would prefer to vote third party, but the system is so unbalanced that voting third party is almost like not voting at all."
706,Trump will set America and minorities back. / Hillary Clinton is the only choice to protect minorities and women.
707,"As Robert Miles stated, Hillary is not perfect but she is clearly intelligent. Donald Trump has no experiences, failed businesses, degrades women and is racist. This should not be a question, because it is an obvious no brainer. Having to explain WHY I dislike Donald Trump is exactly what is wrong with the world today..."
708,"I do not trust Hillary because of all of the scandals she has been a part of for the last 30+ years. She says one thing, but does another. I am not a huge supporter of Trump, however I will probably vote for him in order to hopefully not get Clinton elected. She IS crooked and this country cannot take 4 more years of the same failed policies it has had to endure for the last 8 years."
709,I think they are both cartoon like and utterly disgusting 
710,"Trump is bully, a racist, a sexists pig and sexual harasser. I cannot fathom how the American people allowed him to be their choice for Republican presidential candidate. He's not qualified to be mayor of a medium to small town, let alone leader of the free world. /  / Clinton is not my first choice for democratic candidate. Bernie Sanders filled that role for me. However, Clinton is well qualified to be president and will likely work hard to do good for this nation and it's people. I respect her for her years of service throughout her life and career. She's not perfect, but she's not what many Trump supporters make her out to be. The private email server and Wikileaks bullshit means absolutely nothing to me. And to make matters even better, we will hopefully have our first female president. Something I have personally been hoping would happen for quite some time."
711,"Trump doesn't have the temperament to be president or the experience.  Clinton has more experience, but it is not all good, and she is a liar."
712,"I strongly believe that Hillary Clinton is the best choice for President.  I think she is a hard-working pragmatist, which is what the country needs.  I don't think that she is perfect and sometimes she makes questionable judgment calls but she is by far better than the alternative. I believe that Donald Trump is a narcissistic eqotist with ADD who doesn't have the temperament or knowledge to be President of the United States."
713,I think Hilary Clinton is okay but I do not like Donald Trump 
714,"I am not very happy with either one of them. Hillary Clinton is a proven liar, the Clintons are very corrupt and she did many things that were wrong as Secretary of State. On the other hand I am not thrilled with Donald Trump either. He can be very rude and abrasive and has said many things I don't agree with."
715,I feel that Hillary has the best intentions of our country in contrast to trump.
716,"I feel like there is more to worry about with Trump than Clinton. Hillary knows her way around politics in ways that Trump cannot. I'm afraid because of this, and if Trump is elected that he will be the American doormat and be easily persuaded by lobbyists and opponents of the progressive movement that we so desperately need more of. I'm terrified that the country would move backwards from all of our progress if Trump is elected."
717,"I do not agree with Donald Trump's issues. He is only out for himself, not the American people. Hillary Clinton is a liar and thief her issue on abortion really upsets me. I do not plan on voting on either of them. They both scare me."
718,I believe that Hillary Clinton is the better choice based off of experience and knowledge on the issues. Although Donald Trump can be considered a successful businessman I don't think he's in the business of running an entire country. I think that America has a better chance of becoming better and improving with Hillary. I feel like we would regress a great deal with Donald Trump leading our country. 
719,"My vote is anti-politician and anti-big business, I think that Trump could level the playing field. I know that the Clintons would be bad news no matter what."
720,They both suck. I would've voted for Bernie.
721,"Either candidate is the best to be president of USA, but at this time I will vote for Hilary. Trump is so selfish and racist, he just car about people like him, he's arguments to be president are no strong enough or even have any sense. Because of him this elections is been like a tv show  for the world and letting people around the world know that Americans are dumb and they just want a famous person that destroy they country."
722,"trump is dangerous for america, thats all i need to know "
723,"I think that Hillary has not proved that she can be trusted.  If she is opening her mouth, you can assume that she is lying.  Trump is not a politician.  He hasn't been trained on how to manipulate others as a politician.  He isn't trying to be President for the money.  I believe he has America's best interest at heart."
724,"I think a lot of drama is taking place like actors on the stage especially with Trump. Serious issues and concerns of Americans citizens are expressed by politicians when politicians wants a vote but what really is ever done. Mostly, very little."
725,I don't like either one. I'm picking the lesser of 2 evils. Which frustrates me. I was hoping that this was the year that a 3rd party candidate would have a chance.
726,"Trump is a terrible joke of a person who people fell for because they imbue him with their own hateful beliefs. Clinton is deceitful. While she is better than Trump, I don't  trust her. Jill Stein isn't the best candidate either, but at least she's more trustworthy than Trump or Clinton."
727,"Hillary Clinton is pretty much an average politician -- I wouldn't say I like or trust her, necessarily, but she'd be no worse than any other president we've had in the last few decades. Donald Trump is an evil little troll doll who thinks women are objects, immigrants are subhuman and a string of failed businesses makes you a genius."
728,"In his hatred of Muslims, scapegoating of immigrants, praise of strongmen leaders like Putin and Hussein, threats to retaliate against the media, his courtship of white nationalists, and the fundamental promise that *he alone* can make America great again, Trump has displayed fascist tendencies. He's also simple-minded, vain, and misogynist. His presidency would be catastrophic. /  / Clinton is very knowledgeable and credible. She's more pragmatic and honest about policy than the average politician. She'll be a fine President."
729,"There's a lot of misinformation and non-news coming out of both campaigns. A lot of coverage has been given to Donald Trump and his supporters don't really seem to be looking at the bigger picture: he has no plans for his proposals, thrives on demonizing the other and is otherwise ridiculous. Hillary Clinton is knowledgeable and has experience as a statesperson. Her stances have changed over time, but then times and societal attitudes are changing, thankfully for the better and are becoming more inclusive to more people (i.e. gay marriage is legal and health care is finally viewed as a necessity)."
730,"While I dislike Hillary for several reasons, I dislike Trump even more."
731,"I do not support Donald Trump because he sees too many issues in black and white when often you have to compromise.  Also, I think he will do or say things just to get attention and I don't think his policies will help the lower class or will help world peace.  Clinton is at least a better candidate because she is more thoughtful and will be more pragmatic even if it means giving in to other countries."
732,"I support Donald Trump, He is in for the best interest of the country and its people."
733,"I think Trump is the worst candidate I've seen in my lifetime (at least, that's gotten anywhere as close as he has to the Presidency.) I understand his appeal in the sense that he's not afraid to say things in an unfiltered way, but he's boorish, uninformed, divisive, and dangerous. /  / I think Clinton is very qualified on paper to be President, but I have the same untrustworthy complaint that a lot of other people do. For my taste, she's far too big-business and war-hawk. I think a vote for her is a vote for the status quo. I normally wouldn't be voting for her, but since Trump is completely unacceptable to me, I have little choice."
734,I am a black and asian woman. It is hard -rather: IMPOSSIBLE- to not see the blatant divide of class via systemic racism in this country. There is not a single person that can vote for Trump and not know that he will also usher in a massive revelation of closet racists. It's already begun. Pocs suffer a civil rights crisis. That is a fundamental issue that cannot be ignored or prioritized less than anything. People are having their HUMAN RIGHTS stolen every second of every day. I prefer Sanders but I will agree to vote for Hillary for the sheer fact that you can not even agree with some of Trump and act like the racist baggage he carries isn't part of the package he will bring to the presidency. 
735,"I voted for Clinton because of her vast amount of experience creating the ability to create change.  I have great difficulty with the email controversy, however.  Trump is a strong leader but he is just too self-involved and volatile for the office of president."
736,"Without any experience in government, Presidential candidate Donald Trump has no idea the ability he will have to actually change things.  Hilary at least knows how things really work."
737,Neither one can be trusted. 
738,I favor Trump more because I do not trust Clinton. She has been proven to be a liar. 
739,Hillary Clinton is extremely corrupt and only cares about himself. Donald Trump is patriotic and is not owned by anyone.
740,"I think clinton has and always will be for the person or persons who pay her the most.It,s been proven before.I like trumph becouse he is not a career politician and i think he can make a real difference."
741,"If I did not live in a swing state, I would not vote for Hillary Clinton. While she is by far the superior candidate as opposed to Trump, I don't believe that she is always truthful. On the other hand, Trump is an absolutely atrocious human being and a laughable ""politician."" "
742,"Clinton is the lesser of two evils.  I am not her biggest supporter, but I do not wish to see anyone even slightly more conservative take office."
743,"Donald trump is the last hope for america, there will never be another chance. Hillary will be the end. We are living a decline, and people will suffer the consequences of their bad judgment and rampant ignorance. "
744,Both candidates are flawed however I do slightly tilt towards Clinton. I may either sit this one out or vote for Gary Johnson or a write in candidate.
745,Neither of these candidates are ideal and I don't know how we got to this point. Neither are trust worthy and neither seem like respectable upstanding citizens. I will vote Gary Johnson because he is the best candidate for the job as President. Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump only have the advantage of the two party system. Both are terrible candidates.
746,I am on Trumps side.  I feel he is honest and will work really hard to correct all the damage that has been done by Obama.  Clinton will destroy is and terrorism will probably wipe us out.
747,"I think that choosing between these candidates is ""choosing the lesser of two evils"". I think the only major upside is that Hilary would be the first women president and I believe that would send a very strong message. She may not be the best president, but she'll be setting a great example for women and young girls around the world.  /  / Donald Trump just deserves to be assassinated if he were to become president. He's disgrace to the American people he wants to represent. "
748,"I don't have a favorable view of eithe candidate, but it's more unfavorable to Hillary, which as far as I am concerned thinks she is above the law. People fear about our national security with Trump, but that is exactly what Killery is being investigated for and has been found to have violated by her emails, the Clintons are crooked and don't care about anything more than making money."
749,Both are horrible candidates. If the people had any guts or backbone they would  have rejected these two and supported two others for the contest of presidency.
750,"If Trump wins, it will be bad for our long term economy, national security and just about everything else. Hes only in this for his ego. He doesn't really care. Clinton has many flaws but she has experience and knows what it takes to run this country"
751,I think Hillary Clinton has more relevant experience and more appropriate presentation of herself compared to Donald Trump.  I think she will work more for the average person's betterment.
752,I beleive Donald Trump will do nothing for this country. He has no knowledge about politics and world affairs. Hilary is more of a representable candidate and she seems like she cares.
753,"Hillary is a highly qualified candidate, and a sleazy millionaire lawyer.  Trump is a sleazy real estate developer, felon, tax dodging billionaire."
754,"I think Donald Trump is a a snake: non-trustworthy, clever, and extremely dangerous. I think Hillary Clinton is a fraud and a cheater."
755,I don't really like either of them to much but this is the choice for the election. It is a tough choice between the two. Hillary has trust issues and Trump has no experience.
756,"Donald Trump is not the perfect candidate - he isn't polished and smooth. While the does carry some negatives with it I believe that imperfection is what I like about him. Perfection is fake and that describes an enormous number of politicians today, They are all just as flawed or likely more flawed than Trump - they are simply well trained at hiding those flaws. Trump represents kind of a throwback to at least towards what the framers intended politicians to represent. In my opinion the idea was for citizens to give up a period of time in their life to serve and then return to their life after serving. It was never meant to be a lifelong career in which politicians will literally do anything to remain in office. I am always amazed at how so many politicians come into office at a particular level of wealth and when they leave office they have increased their wealth by staggering amounts. Their wealth is increased well beyond the salary they receive for serving. Where do you think that money comes from? No one in politics can ever seem to answer that question - well they could but they simply won't. Flip to the opposite page from Trump and you have Hillary Clinton - the perfect example of everything I do not like in a public servant. She has made a lifelong career out of politics and is very polished and smooth and will do anything to remain in office. She has made an enormous fortune on a public servant's salary. You cannot believe anything she says or trust her motives for anything she does. She has no qualities I find redeeming in a public servant."
757,Hillary is a liar and a murderer. She cannot be trusted. Donald Trump wants to help people out and do things to benefit them.
758,NA
759,"Mrs. Hillary Clinton has a long political history that appear tarnished by past ethically questionable actions.   The Whitewater scandal, her activities with the Rose law firm, and the impression that she 'covers' up and mishandles/misuses information and documents dogs her.  I feel she has proven she cannot be trusted.  Mr. Donald Trump also has engaged in ethically questionable behavior.  He also gives the impression of a man who does not see the connectivity of one action/statement/day to the next.  He seems to think he can say or do anything he wants and then the next day, deny the statements that the American public found offensive or disagreeable.  He seemingly lacks any real convictions."
760,"Hillary Clinton has said that she will continue the policies of the current president. These policies from a logical standpoint are not good for the country overall. Also, Hillary has many skeletons in her closet with the email scandal, Benghazi, Travelgate, and several other scandals. /  / Donald Trump is an enigma. He says that he will make America great again. Personally, I don't know if he can do that because America has a morality problem. However, I would rather vote for Trump over Hillary because as mentioned earlier, she will continue the failed policies of the current president which will continue to take the country in the wrong direction and eventually over the cliff."
761,"Hillary Clinton is the most qualified candidate based on her experience. Trump is an adulterous misogynist con man who has admitted to multiple sexual assaults, avoiding taxes and not paying contractors. / "
762,Hilary Clinton will be a steady force of progress. Donald Trump is a maniac
763,NA
764,"I think Hillary is more qualified, but she is more corrupt. Donald is more honest, but he doesn't have a filter and is too thin skinned when it comes to criticism. "
765,"Hillary is far from perfect and problematic. However, Trump is appealing to a base that has not come to the realization that he has never cared about. It's interesting to see how much a segment of the population is willing to sacrifice to appeal to their racist, misogynist and xenophobic fever dreams. This is truly a lesser of the evils situation. "
766,I think trump did not start the race issues but he gave voice to an anger people. He is selfish and will do damage. Clinton is not perfect but she can help the goverment
767,"I think Trump is the only real hope we have in the choices between the two. He is an outsider who can overturn and really shake up and clean out (hopefully) all the corrupt and bought, lying and deceiving, cut from the same cloth politicians who are in place. None of the candidates are perfect or even really great by a long shot, but with Hillary I fear the absolute worst. War, chaos and death follow her footsteps and the dictations of the elites like George Soros and others who whisper in her ears and pull the strings of pretty much all the past presidents (Republican and Democrat!). Those elites are utterly scared; that ought to say enough right there - they see their control and power threatened. Hillary will continue the downfall of the country (I don't doubt that's their agenda in the first place), but at least with Trump there is but even a tiny bit of hope that things can get better."
768,"Donald Trump has a couple very good points but is very radical. While Hilary is just a liar. But they really both are, lets face it:/"
769,"Hillary is a lying, murderous crook."
770,"I favor Gary Johnson because I think he is more intelligent and selfless than Clinton or Trump. I prefer his libertarian principles of small government. I think that Clinton and Trump are both self obsessed, and they want larger government. They want to force their own ideas on others. They don't think very hard about important issues, or consider all the different perspectives on a given issue. They would both be awful presidents."
771,I think trump has no experience and is certainty racist. I think Clinton is a liar and believes she can do whatever she wants. 
772,"In voting for Trump, it is not a sign of support, however it is an anti-Clinton vote. I have never had the experience of witnessing two completely unqualified candidates seeking the Presidency. I wouldn't trust Clinton if my life depended on it and it may end up being the case. At least Trump appears to want to do the right thing with America. Clinton's history is checkered and she cannot seem to be able to tell the truth on anything. I place a high value in honesty and I would never support her."
773,"Donald Trump is a threat to America's safety and economy. He is unfit for office, and is a disgusting representation of the republican party. Hillary Clinton is the best candidate in this election because of her strong political background and dedication to improve our country."
774,"I believe that Donald Trump does not have a strong platform to support any of his ideas. He says he will fix things but has no formal plans. He is mostly rhetoric. I also don't agree with his thoughts on social issues. Hilary, although her character is possibly in question, I believe shares similar views as I do and will progress the country."
775,"Hillary is totally immoral, Trump is a patriot."
776,"I'm disgusted with our candidates.  Hillary will say whatever is needed to get votes and is guilty of obstructing justice, yet she has no consequences.  Donald Trump is a moron who doesn't have a clue about what he is talking about.  His stances on all topics are very ambiguous and general; he doesn't have specific ideas on how to solve problems.  He is also as unprofessional as it gets."
777,"Donald Trump is not someone I would choose for being president. To me, he lacks compassion and understanding of America. I vote for Clinton because she is real and understands what is best for this country."
778,Both candidates are having almost equal percentage of likeliness and non-likeliness. Both are having positive and negative aspects. We should choose on our basic interest towards the person to whom we should support.
779,my opinion on Hilary clinton is that she is a liar and  should be in prison. Donald is the best candidate we have.
780,"Donald Trump really frightens me. I am actually scared of him getting elected. His promise to bring back manufacturing is very hollow to me, as I believe automation is the far bigger factor in the decline of blue collar manufacturing jobs. His attitudes toward women, minorities, and the disabled are disgusting. His ties with Russia are troubling. His fixation on using nuclear weapons is horrifying. His willful ignorance alone makes him unqualified in my opinion. Hillary I feel is a great candidate, extremely qualified, and I could not care less about the email ""scandal."" "
781,I think that Hillary Clinton is just the same type of person we always pick. Nothing changes and things really just continue to get worse. Donald Trump just really talks about issues that people like me can in fact relate too. Although he is also not experienced. I am really undecided. 
782,I am horrified by the thought of Trump even having a chance for the highest office in the country.  I cannot believe that people are putting their prejudice ahead of country.  A lot of these people voting him where not prepared for a 21st century economy and they think he is going to solve it.  That will never happen. He wants to be king.  Hilary is smart and capable.  The email nonsense is cooked up by the cray GOP who want to control the country.  She will be able to run this country and I have know doubt the country will be better off because she can get things done.  The republicans are scared of her and that is why they are going to continue these hearing and attacks.  We are stronger together than letting a few men have control of the country.
783,My views are that Trump is a very dishonest person and an instigator. He only wants to win presidency to say he won but he doesn't want to deal with the responsibility that comes with the position. Hillary Clinton has the experience and the intelligence to deal with international policies but also hasn't proven herself to be an honest person. I believe that both will bring us to war.
784,"Trump cares more about himself and how he looks rather than the well-being of our country and our people. Hillary isn't in it just for herself, she has flaws too just like Trump but what human being doesn't have flaws? Hillary seems to care more about the interest of our people."
785,I do not trust Hillary Clinton and do not think she's forgot be president she should be in prison after what happened in benghazi and all the emails Idon't doyou believe that Trump has the peoples best interests at heart although he does not have experience to be running for president I do feel he would make a much better president than Hilary ever would
786,"Trump is a corrupt businessman, Clinton a corrupt politician.  Neither deserve the office of president.  Period.  I'm not voting for the lesser of evil, I'm voting for the greater good, it's the only chance this country has.  I am supporting Jill Stein."
787,I think both candidates are very poor choices for the office of the president. / I think both candidates are corrupt and wish i didn't have either of them to choose from.
788,"Despite all the statements about Donald Trump, I feel once he assumes the presidency, his bombastic self serving rhetoric will change.  I believe hei fart more center of the raod than he will let us see at the moment.  I still will not vote for him because of his conservative values and statements .  I will vote for Hillary Clinton, who may have some politcal baggage but has the essential critical knowledge and skills to lead a country ."
789,"Trump is a racist bigot, while Hillary is a puppet and liar. I honestly can't tell you which is the least of the two evils. Johnson's plans are somewhat poorly thought out, but I feel he's the least likely to do any serious damage to the country (and congress will stop him from implementing any stupid policies anyway)."
790,"I think Donald Trump is an idiot basically. He's ignorant, racist, a cheater, a con-artist, a sexual assaulter, and if you believe he cares about anything other his brand and lining his own pockets then there's no helping you. I detest the blind ignorance of his supporters. I'm not crazy about Hillary and I don't trust her very much, but compared to him, she looks like a dream and is the far better choice. I'm all for change and shaking up the system, but not with someone as unqualified as Donald Trump. It's frightening how much people in this country worship celebrity. "
791,I think they are both corrupt in their own ways and that no matter which of the two are elected I think our country will be on a steep downhill but I hope that I am proven wrong 
792,"I do not believe in abortion and this is the main reason why I am leaning towards Trump. I don't feel that either person should be president. However, since I am STRONGLY against abortion I have to go with Trump."
793,"Clinton has proven herself to be dishonest on numerous occasions. / Trump appears to be more patriotic and for the people. / They both have their negatives.  / Clinton has already had her chance to ""prove herself"" to the American people, hope Trump will win the presidency."
794,I am truly picking the lesser of two evils.
795,Hilary is really the lesser of two evils.  I fear if Trump is president it will be a huge mistake and he will offend so many people that we will end up having a civil war as well as a world war on our hands.  He is a loss cannon.
796,"I dislike Trump and Clinton. I do not like any of the choices for President this year, including the third parties. This might be the first time in my adult life that I do not vote for the President, but instead just stick to voting for my local issues and ignoring the rest. "
797,"I think Donald Trump is an unviable candidate, he is racist and will lead the country into ruin. Hilary Clinton, while not being the best candidate, the most trustworthy, aligns with my beliefs the most and is capable of running our country. Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are also unviable in my opinion. "
798,I support Hillary Clinton because of her demonstrated life experience. Donald Trump does not have the temperament or experience to be President and has embarrassed himself and diminished his family. I am paying particular attntion to the election in the hope we will see an end to the gridlock permeating Congress. For that reason I hope we see the Senate change hands. Clinton will be able to move us forward  if she has a Congress interested in something besides their party affiliations.
799,I dislike both Clinton and Trump strongly in regards to presidency. I think they both have inexcusable acts that they have committed to make me feel this way. This is why I have decided to vote Libertarian in this election even though I consider myself mostly a Republican. Both Trump and Clinton I fear would make us worse off as a nation in a lot of ways and I wonder how we as Americans came to the place of having them be the two candidates. 
800,"Donald Trump is a dangerous man. Not because of the power that he has necessarily, but because of the ideologies that he is inciting in our country.  /  / Hillary is not to be trusted. But she is competent to do the job and she is the lesser of two evils."
801,I think that the candidates both have significant flaws and reflect the current state of our society which is a very troubling realization considering both Trump and Hillary are very questionable potential leaders for the United States. Johnson has some good ideas as does Stein but the chances of either one being a legitimate threat are no chance. It's a shame Bernie got unethically edged out and more or less bought off by Hillary. It's a shame new progressive ideas that seem to have gained a tremendous amount of support is received and snuffed out that way..
802,"Though I feel Clinton can be dishonest and in it for herself, it is not to the extent that Trump is. He will bully people and brag about it, and that is not a role model I want to have around. I might be having kids soon, and I don't want to live in a country where the president thinks so poorly of women, minorities, and those less fortunate. "
803,"I think Clinton has more experience, and a better pulse of what is going on in America. I think Trump is a great businessman,  but there are different rules you must follow in government. I think trump has tapped into a certain anti-government rhetoric which some people are feeding off of. Albeit not a bad concept, but his tact on making change is too extreme. "
804,Hillary is pro minorities Donald is anti minorities. Hiliary is pro woman Donald is anti woman. I'm a woman and a minority.
805,I think Donald Trump is racist and he is a dickhead.  Hillary is alright.
806,"I believe Hillary is the safer choice. However, I believe Trump has more potential to doing great things but also very very bad things. I struggle to choose between the ""safer"" option and the ""more potential"" option."
807,"Clinton is focused on helping women and minorities, but Trump wants to push us back to the 1950s. He finds women ti be objects, not people. he is hateful towards immigrants, and is a cheat. Clinton is strong, clearheaded, and a will be an excellent president."
808,I fear that Hillary is going to win the election and ruin our great nation. Trump is the lesser of two evils.
809,"I think they are both pretty terrible candidates for president. However, Hillary can not be trusted. While Trump is not ideal, Hillary is actually dangerous. She has proven that she abuses her power for her own benefit and I believe that is she is elected some very negative historic events will take place. "
810,They're both scum and Ron Paul should be President.
811,"I find that both candidates are the worst major party selections in history. Hillary is corrupt and can not be trusted. Donald has pros and cons, but is a loose canon. I can not respect either one of them. The two 3rd party options are both very respectable, and each would make a very honorable president. "
812,"I think Trump is a very crass man. His views on women, people of color, and just the world in general are terrible and outdated. I do not think he should be a role model for anyone much less a representative of this country. Clinton, while she has her flaws, is much preferable as a Politician and a President. She is well-spoken and well-versed on the issues. I feel she'd actually listen to an individual and take their words into considerations whereas Trump is a 'my way or the highway' type of leader. "
813,I think this is the worst election ever.  It is like saying here are 2 piles of poop. Pick the one that has the least amount of flies. 
814,"I believe Hillary Clinton is the more liberal of the two, and has the best interests of the country at heart. I think Donald Trump has his own best interests at heart."
815,"Hilliary is a liar, Trump is a bully.  Two worst choices ever!"
816,"Both are liars, but I think that Donald Trump is a psychopath and a dangerous man. "
817,I think both candidates are horrible people that are bad for the country as a whole.
818,"I cannot in good conscience vote for either. A liar and a bigot, those are our choices, so with that in mind I have to do what is the honorable thing and choose neither."
819,I support Hillary Clinton because her policy positions are closest to my own. I do not support Trump because his views are divisive. 
820,"I dont really care for either candidate, but I definitely dont want Trump to win."
821,"Neither are particularly trustworthy. Neither inspire confidence or enthusiasm. One (Clinton) is competent, and the other isn't. That said, I will be voting for Jill Stein. "
822,"dt- i believe is a start to a much needed change. is it going to happen overnight?.. no but he relates to a common american. wealth or not, he is not a bought out politician /  / hc- she is the same of what we have had the last 30 years. a well groomed/bought out politician. we need rid of these career politicians and a common man back in office"
823,They both seem to br creating and fostering the belief that the two parties are so diametrically opposed that intelligent and calm discussion is impossible and though I do believe Clinton is better she has a history of wildly varying opinions depending on when and whos around when youre talking to her and given the current election neither has talked policy( besides vague socially current topics in months) so while I support Clinton I honestly have no clue were her policy stand now and they could have change in the last few months since shes spoken of them
824,Very good
825,"I find Trump to be pompous and ill mannered, I find Clinton to be smart and well intentioned"
826,"I dislike both candidates but I dislike more what Clinton stands for.  A lot of candidates run on platforms of change.  Clinton's catch-phrase is stronger together yet she is dividing americans and trying to get elected by patronizing african americans and latinos/""undocumented"".  Trump is not presidential but after eight years of nonsense (lowest premiums ever my ass Hillary) its time for a new, American perspective."
827,"I think that they are very focused on their goals. They like to insult each other, and that the "
828,I like Hillary Clinton because she has more experience than Donald Trump.  I do not like Donald Trump because he is a bully.  Hillary Clinton has a better temperament to be the president than Donald Trump.
829,Donald Trump is unqualified to be president. Hillary Clinton is qualified to be president. 
830,Hillary cannot do as much damage as Trump. It's a choice between two evils but she is the far more preferable of the two.
831,"I feel as though Hilary Clinton is very currpot.  I feel as though if she were any other person she would be in jail right now.  She has used money to not only stay out of jail but to become a presidential candidate.  She has no idea the troubles of the average American.  She speaks a good game and has a convincing grandma face, but is not like any grandma you would like to have.  Trump is more honest.  He may say horrible things, but that is because it is what he actually believes.  He is less intelligent and not a great public speaker, but I believe he will do the things he says he will do."
832,I think Clinton is an evil liar and a murderer. There are bodies dropping around her throughout her and her husband's careers. She is fake and is only looking out for herself. She is a hypocrite. Trump may not be the nicest candidate to ever run but I like that he says what he means and I hope that most of what he promises comes to be true.
833,"I am afraid a Trump presidency and cabinet will attempt to overturn Roe V. Wade. I fear that they will also defund planned parenthood. Iuse PP for yearly gynocological visits and birth control, without them ,I will have to see a specialist that I can not afford, and my cost of BC will go up substantially. I think that is bad because it also shows that Trump doesn't understand women's needs. I like Hillary because she will not do those things."
834,"The candidates for the presidential election are limited, so strategic voting is necessary to choose the lesser evil of the two main candidates."
835,"There is no good side, I think we can establish that. But I am a Bernie Sanders supporter, and in order for him to take control on the Senate, we need a Hillary Clinton presidency, and I absolutely support that. I may not like Clinton 100% in terms of who she is, and her past, but I agree with what she wants to put in place as a president, and I will vote for that. Trump is much too racist and hateful. He has no compassion, and is quite stupid, and hypocritical. I do not agree with him on anything. I also absolutely will NOT vote for someone who is stupid enough to think that climate change is a hoax. He is literally rejecting science, and that is ludicrous to me. I also believe I should have the rights to my own body; he is a selfish being. He is a misogynist, and I will not support a rapist."
836,"Hillary is a phony and has committed many crimes due to her greed and lust for power.  She belongs in jail not the White House.  Her crimes are obvious and the evidence is overwhelming.   If you can't see this, ask a 12 year-old child to explain it to you.  Hillary cares about Hillary, not the well-being of America.   /  / Trump although somewhat brash, is not a career politician and is not in it for the money.  I think he genuinely cares about America. "
837,NA
838,I am wary of the hype and rhetoric on both sides. A choice between two major players with massive concerns is not much of a choice. I am discouraged at the way this (and most) elections have proceeded. Trump seems like a salesman hawking a snake-oil product while Clinton seems like a shyster out for whatever personal advantage she can gain.
839,"The bipartisan candidates are both awful, but no one stands behind third-party candidates enough to make them viable. Nevertheless, Johnson has my vote because his philosophies are the most similar to mine and if the country could just ditch the bipartisan farce, we could have better options this go around."
840,"I think Hillary has the experience to run the country and I agree with most of her views on social policy and foreign affairs.  I find nothing to align me with Donald Trump.  He is a bigot, and not able to run his own business without resorting to bankruptcy.  I don't think he could run any country, much less one as complex as America.  "
841,"i think that they ARE BOTH VERY GOOD. If i had to , i would  vote for hilary. all in all, they are just looking out for themselves"
842,"I think that both candidates are bad.  This election is like a nightmare, or The Twilight Zone."
843,"Trump is a misogynistic panderer.He really has no set of views I can grasp and debate. /   Hillary is a sleazy, lying fraud.I despise her even more than the Donald."
844,"I think Trump is a bigot with ultra conservative ideals. He is scary and disrespects women. Although I am not a huge fan of Hillary, I do think she has good ideas and is much more qualified."
845,"Hillary isn't perfect, but Trump is dangerous. How anyone with any decency can vote for a man who mocks handicapped people and belittles women is just mind blowing."
846,"I am not really a fan of Donald Trump, however, I won't sell my soul by voting for Killery.  She should have been in jail long ago.  Donald Trump's biggest downfall is he's too passionate to hold his tongue still when he gets upset.  Hillary's biggest downfall is she's as corrupt as they come.  From Watergate to Weinergate, she's proven that she will do and say whatever it takes to get what she wants.  It's those types of people that should be disqualified from any type of office. "
847,"I voted for Clinton and I wasn't very happy with the decision, but it was better than a vote for trump in my opinion. It was really depressing to look at the ballot and have to choose between these two. If I had the funds to move to another country, I would be on the next plane. America's fucked in the head!"
848,I feel that Hillary Clinton is full of lies and Donald Trump is not nearly prepared to be President of the United States.
849,"I am not particularly in favor of Hillary Clinton, but I think that Donald Trump would be a disaster for this country. He is dishonest and bigoted. And it is terrifying to think that so many people in this country support him."
850,"I think that Clinton is the most qualified, but not trustworthy. I think that Trump could have been a good choice, but he has gathered too much support from racists. Either way, we are in trouble as a nation."
851,I feel both candidates are flawed.  It will be hard to lead America forward with the two choices.  It is terrible that no other qualified candidate in both parties were given a chance to be voted on.  
852,"We are screwed! I choose to support the one who is pro life and hasn't turned their head to breaking major security breaches. It would also POSSIBLY be good to have a non lifetime-politician in there for a change. I just pray he learns how to control his mouth, which is unlikely. So, like I said, either way I do not feel good about either candidate. Trump is a smart man and has some smart people working for him and he is good at delegating which is important. That shows he is a good leader to start."
853,"While I do agree that Trump would be horrible for our country,  I resent  being made to vote for someone as evil as Hilary to assure he doesn't get into office. "
854,"I don't care for either of the main candidates. Both of them lack character. Clinton seems far worse, though because she tells each group what she thinks they want to hear, rather than what she believes. Plus, she has constantly been surrounded by charges of criminal acts throughout her life. The accusations against Trump concerning women just surfaced now, a few weeks out from the election!  So they seem not very credible. These women have had years to speak out and are just doing it now? Odd!"
855,"The 2016 Presidential Election leaves me feeling a great deal of disappointment when it comes to the candidates- /  / Donald Trump cannot even be considered a politician, as he has no prior experience working in the Public Sector. He is also ill-tempered and unconventionally opinionated, leaving a great deal of chance for something to go horribly wrong in his politics. People like him because he's not afraid to step on toes, but that's precisely why we should be scared of a Trump Presidency. /  / Hillary Clinton is the lesser of the two evils when we're discussing through this Two-Party system. She is corrupt and sneaky, which means she carries quite a bit of baggage with her wherever she goes, and if that baggage infiltrates the White House for 4 years, we'll find ourselves in quite a bit of hot water. However, as much as we hate to admit it, every politician is somewhat corrupt, and has things going on behind closed doors. The only difference is Hillary was exposed for it. It worries me more that she's not skilled enough to keep it behind those closed doors. I'm 100% unhappy that it happens, but if we knew everything that went on in politics we would be in a state of chaos. / "
856,"Despite the fact that Donald Trump does not think before he speaks, I believe that as an outsider he will be able to incite some sort of positive change on Capitol Hill. I also appreciate the fact that he is not a part of the ""Good Ole Boys"" club. In terms of Hillary, I do not believe she should even have been permitted to run for president as she was and now is again part of a federal investigation. Frankly, the skeletons in Hillary Clinton's closet concern me much more than those in Trump's. "
857,I believe both of them can't be trusted and I stand undecided because it is hard to determine which one i trust more. 
858,"I am really not in favor of any of them.  I think Trump ""talks big"" and doesn't how to implement any of his plans.  Clinton has a hint of dishonesty and only stayed with her husband to get ahead politically."
859,"Donald Trump openly carries favor with racists, he is the next step in the GOP's drive to use racism to win over the working class. Hillary Clinton is a terrible candidate but at least she isn't being supported by the KKK."
860,Trump is a bad dude with very bad ideals. Hillary is really shady but is the lesser of two evils.
861,"My vote is for Hillary since she favours middle class people like me. Moreover, I am not favorable for Donald Trump at all. Hillary will surely do something for our country's betterment. "
862,"I can't in conscience vote for either Donald or Hillary, they're are both liars that are potentially bad for our country. However, if I was absolutely forced to choose, I think Hillary is a safer choice."
863,"I dislike Hillary because she's the epitome of a lying, scandal-plagued politician who says one thing to the public and an entirely different thing to people behind closed doors. She's corrupt, money hungry woman who cheated to win the DNC. Additionally, paying thugs to incite violence and harm innocent people is just wrong. And she screwed the Haitians out of their relief money and accepts millions from foreign governments (that punish/execute women and gays) in a pay for play scheme while claiming she's a champion for gay and women's rights. Not to mention the racist/sexist/anti-Semitic nonsense spewed in her emails while hypocritically calling Trump those very words. I could go on and on and on... /  / Trump on the other hand can't be bought and I sincerely believe he's in it for the American people. His views on terror, trade, the economy, healthcare AND TAXES are so much more appealing than Hillary's.  Trump isn't perfect nor is he a saint, but I'll take my chances with him rather than another lying politician who sits back and does nothing while the people continue to suffer."
864,"I'm not really fond of Clinton but I think she has the temperament and intelligence needed to be our next president.  I don't really like the secrecy she is know for but I think that between the two candidates, she is the best choice. /  / I do not like Trump at all.  He is an entertainer who knows exactly what his supporters want to hear and that's what he preaches.  He may not believe the crap he is saying but he knows his supports believe it so he will continue the rhetoric.  He doesn't handle himself very well when attack and lack self control.  He would be a poor choice."
865,"Hillary Clinton seems to be a politician who genuinely wants to be of public service, but has the burden of a lifetime spent negotiating a financially motivated political landscape and all the obligations that brings.   /  / Donald Trump seems to want power for himself alone. He makes no effort to build a consensus even with his own party or own campaign. There is no team and it seems clear that Trump has no desire for one. Nothing could seem less American, or democratic, to me than having a leader clearly unwilling to work with others. "
866,Trump is an egomaniac with no clear plans for the future. He breeds hatred and having him in office would be a disaster.
867,Hilary is clearly the safer option. Trump should be in charge of our country. Hilary can at least do no worse than what she's already done.
868,"I think that America is in bad shape.   It is very sad that we only have these two candidates to choose from.  Either way, we will not improve the country with candidates of this caliber."
869,"Donald Trump is a patriot. He lives here, loves it here, and is tired of it not being a great country like it once was. His wallet is affected by the economy just like everyone else's. He is not sitting back and letting someone else fix it, and probably mess it up more. He is standing up and taking control.  Isn't that what having the wealth and influence that he has is supposed to be used for?  He is doing what we teach our kids to do. Stand up and be proud of your country. Stand up for what's right. Amen to Donald Trump."
870,"I agree almost completely with the blog post. I have a lot of concerns about Trump's impulsiveness and childish behavior and how that could seriously negatively impact the US. Trump talks out both side of his mouth and comes off negatively way more than positively especially in ""behind the scenes"" and unscripted events.  / I'm not thrilled with Hillary but she is absolutely far better qualified. I also see her husband as an asset since he was POTUS. Her experience within the system, her concern for social issues, and her contacts within the Washington heirarchy are all assets in this election."
871,Donald Trump is dangerous.  Hillary Clinton is experienced.
872,"I am passionately neutral, however, Clinton is a well known figure, and simply, from that, there is some trust. / However, I do NOT understand why Trump is even applying for this job! Has he got nothing else going on???"
873,I do not feel either candidate is qualified to run our country. I do not feel either was the people's choice for the party. This election feels like it is not the people's candidates but instead run by big buissness and politicians. The people are not getting a real voice. I normally vote in elections but I am having a hard time voting this election because neither candidates seem qualified to run the country. 
874,Heart attack vs cancer
875,"Both Hillary and Trump have major issues and I don't feel comfortable voting for either of them.  Clinton matches my views more closely because at least she has a progressive democratic platform negotiated by Bernie that she has to try and stick to.  Donald represents everything about this country that needs to be changed, he is a bigot, an elitist, anti-immigrant and minority, chauvinist. His policies and legislation will mainly help the corporate elites and wealthy, he is only in this for business interests. He welcomes support from white supremacy groups and his dangerous rhetoric is fueling racist sentiment and the rise of the alt right."
876,"I think that is a clear choice, since Trump is rabidly crazy. What other choice is there but Hillary?"
877,"Political leader is better, who thinks fr the betterment of peolple. Hllary has long time experience as political leader, while trump has more smartness to deal with present situation"
878,"I feel that as a woman I am unable to agree with the Trump/ Pence campaign. Both men are very racist, sexist bigots and I would be throwing away everything women have worked for by voting for such a misogynistic candidate."
879,"Both candidates have different skeletons in their closets... mostly exposed and exploited 200% by the media. Hilary Clinton has a lot of experience in government and politics. However, experience does not necessarily mean she is the best candidate. Donald Trump brings a different mindset... an outsider of politics. But this mindset may do more harm than good. "
880,"Donald Trump is a loose canon, but his overall values regarding business and trade favor American jobs. Hillary Clinton is a democratic socialist, which I believe favors too big government. I think a smaller government without so much intervention would be better for most people. I don't think Medicare is well run and I haven't met anyone who Obamacare has helped. College tuition has skyrocketed and most middle class kids cannot afford to go to a decent school. The middle class can't afford their own child's education let alone pay for some other kid's education through higher taxes even if they have saved since their own child was born. Higher taxes and more government programs for healthcare and education wastes a lot of money, let the people control their own money and support small business which will help everyone. Before the problems, like poor education and random violence, in the inner cities can be fixed we need to better support the families there. A single mom barely scraping by cannot give the kids the time they need to do well in school and stay off the streets."
881,They both suck
882,"Between Hillary and Trump, there is no comparison. No, Hillary is not perfect. She has been in public service for several decades so she's made a few mistakes, but no more than your average public servant. Trump is a loud-mouthed, arrogant misogynist who is one insult away from World War 3. He has no business in the White House."
883,"I would like to vote Trump, since I think he will make the American again. I do not like Clinton at all, she lies to the country and peoples. Most of my friends have some opinions with me."
884,I think Clinton is more reliable than Trump. 
885,"I believe that Donald Trump is not to be trusted at all.  The man is the literal definition of a narcissist.  With the people that are behind his campaign, and both their and his history in the political arena, it is imperative that he does not become the President.  On the other hand, despite her obvious flaws and the continuing effort of the Republican Party and their news outlets, Hillary Clinton has the experience and track record to lead our country."
886,#wikileaks. if you are voting for hillary at this point you are a sheep. she is clearly the dirtiest politician of all time. she cannot win if we are too survive as a country. 
887,"Trump is honest and we really need him to do some fixing towards the country. He look s american and talks american. Hilary can take leadership, but it might hurt america in certain places. Trump will do what some others haven't. Hilary just want to make an impression, that she looks good and that's all this country needs."
888,my views are exactly the same views as I read in this survey. Hilary has more experience and I feel trump just has it out for himself.
889,im undecided
890,"Trump is racist, sexist, and inexperienced. Clinton is experienced and will do fine."
891,"I am not a fan of Hillary Clinton's but given that the alternative is Trump, it made my vote very easy to cast. Trump appeals to the lowest common denominator in society and has legitimized racism."
892,Neither of the candidates are very good. Hope we have only one term of either of them.
893,Trump is a loose cannon but I agree with more of his policies. Hilary is a snake in the grass.
894,HILLARY CAN NOT PROTECT CLASSIFIED DOCUMENTS.  ANYONE ELSE WOULD BE IN JAIL OVER THIS.  I STILL BELIEVE SHE WILL HAVE SOMEONE TAKE THE FALL FOR HER.  NOT RIGHT.  HER FOUNDATION IS NOT LEGIT.  SHE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BENGHAZI.  SHE IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL.  DONALD TRUMP IS NOT PRESIDENTIAL MATERIAL EITHER.  BUT HE IS BETTER THAN HILLARY.
895,"At first, I was anti-Tump.  My views on him have progressed to a strong like.  I think he has a better idea of where this country needs to go than Clinton does.  I hope Clinton does not get in office, but I believe she has a better chance than Trump. I will not like it if she does get into office as you can't trust anything that comes out of her mouth. "
896,I believe that the election is hard to swallow this term and it's every person for themselves 
897,I think Hillary is a liar and cannot be trusted. I think Donald Trump is honest and is patriotic. He will do his best to do what is right for this country to get it back on track.
898,"I feel that they are two sides of the same coin. I don't trust either one of them and I don't understand how we got to the point where we have to choose between these two people, of everyone in the country. No matter which one wins we lose as a country."
899,"Donald Trump, to me, is a very dangerous man - Hillary, though a little on the secretive side, is level headed and works tirelessly for the country."
900,"I really fear Donald Trump in office. I think my rights as a woman will be i question. I don't think Hillary is as right for the country as a potential candidate should be, but it's better her than Trump."
901,"Trump's views and ideas change depending on who he is talking to, much more so than other candidates. He also places blame on china and mexico without acknowledging it's in fact american businesses that have shipped ""our"" jobs to those countries. He cannot be trusted to follow through with anything that he says. Clinton isn't much better, but still better than Trump."
902,"I strongly support Trump over Hillary. It's not that I even like Trump all that well. It is how terrible Hillary is. She lies constantly. The email scandal, she said she didn't know the ""C"" ,meant confidential. Seriously?? Why not just admit, hey I made a mistake. It would be a hell of a lot better than telling lies. Trump has made horrible comments about women and different races, but overall I think he would be better than Hillary. "
903,"Donald Trump has been a joke for as long as I can even remember. Hell, even SNL did skits about him in the early 90s, and now he's a viable candidate for presidency? You must be joking. Maybe next year I should run, since I have about as much experience as he does. Except I haven't been accused of sexual assault, rape, excessive fraud, tax evasion, or theft."
904,"Meh, Hillary knows what to do. Fuck Trump."
905,"I am definitely not in favor of a candidate who has commited a felony! That is immoral and goes against what this country stands for. How can you trust a leader like that. Donald Trump may not be perfect, but he is honest and with the right people by his side I believe he will do well to serve as our next President of the United States of America!!"
906,I feel Donald Trump will change america. He will make low class people look for work
907,I don't like either candidate and I'm sick of people telling me how to vote.  I think both are evil and either one in office will not make a difference to me.
908,"I don't think either candidate will be a great president, but I think Hilary Clinton is a slightly better choice."
909,"Trump is likely to upset people with his tendency to speak his mind without thinking first, using wording that can be misunderstood, taking strong positions, and tweeting late at night. He isn't bought by big business or foreign countries. He has reason to do what is right for our country and economy as his kids are in business and he will benefit in having a strong country when he leaves office and most probably returns to real estate.  /  / Hillary is bought by big business and foreign countries. Her ties to middle eastern countries is very troubling. Her mishandling of classified materials is criminal and has shown corruption among many people in government and her ability to control those people and willingness to do so. She has made over $100 million from foreign countries since leaving the white house and recently made a transfer of $1.8 billion to Qatar that can't really be substantiated by their salaries. She has every reason to keep her donors happy and will likely continue to solicit donations in exchange for manipulating her contacts in government for her donors. She has really no reason to do what helps our country, our economy, or our middle class."
910,I'm not sure who to vote for. Clinton is very shady and crooked and Trump is a man child. I don't think either choice is a good one. 
911,"I am not very excited about either candidate, but I believe Clinton is very qualified and will do a good job. Trump is just not fit for the job and while I think having a candidate that is outside of the political norm right now is a great idea, Trump just isn't that person."
912,I think they both suck tremendously. I'm a Libertarian.
913,NA
914,I think that Donald Trump is a dangerous candidate. I think Hillary is a better choice of the two. But I would have preferred to be voting for Bernie Sanders.
915,"As a former Bernie Sanders supporter, I am for Hillary. Trump is far too unpredictable and devoid of substance as well as extremely right wing. With Hillary, there is a decent chance to achieve progressive goals."
916,"I feel they both have their flaws and both are dishonest to an extent. I feel Clinton is better groomed for the position but I like Trumps attitude. They both worry me as one is to polished and well suited for the position but I'm not sure that is what this country needs. The other on is a bit of a wild card which worries me as we still need to be diplomatic. This is not a game, people's lives are at stake and I need my Preident to be calm, cool and collective."
917,I believe Hilary has been involved in a lot of shadiness. I believe she is a liar. I think Trump would be an innovative approach to the society and it is worth giving him a shot. Trump seems more sincere than your average politician.
918,"I support Clinton, because there is a lot more I agree with her on than I do with Trump. I think Trump is not at all a good fit for a president. Whill both candidates have probably lied and done things wrong to a certain degree, Clinton would be a better choice as a person."
919,I think Clinton is a liar and crook. Donald Trump has flaws but is not afraid to change things.
920,"What an awful choice we have, two deeply flawed people, not just candidates, I believe these are bad people.  HRC does not ever tell the truth, not about small things, not about important things, she can't be trusted.  HRC has not done a thing for anyone else's benefit unless there was a benefit to her or her family.  She's bad, she's unethical, she's corrupt.  I will never forgive the democratic party for shoving her down our throats when they were all aware of her deep flaws and conflicts.  they put ""making history"" with a woman ahead of country.  shame on them all."
921,"Trump is dishonest, misogynistic, and in this for himself. Hillary is flawed and guarded but has a long history of public service. Opponents have been trying for many years at great coast to convict Hillary of criminal wrong doing but have been unable to come up with any proof, only accusations."
922,"I feel like Donald Trump lacks the political knowledge and background to be president. He is impulsive, sexist and has racist views of minorities. Hillary Clinton is calculated and power-hungry but has more political experience. "
923,"they both suck, but hillary sucks worse."
924,I don't like either but we need a Republican to fill the open Supreme Court seats. THIS has more ling-term impact than the President.
925,I think Trump is a hate monger and I have never been a fan. Clinton is both strong and stupid for staying with her husband.
926,I am somewhat disappointed in both major party candidates due to all the negative talk. I wish the debates would have focused more on the issues and less on who said or did this or that.
927,"While I am extremely unsatisfied with Hillary Clinton's policies as Secretary of State, i.e. her commitment to neoliberalism, Donald Trump represents a larger threat to the progress that has been made in the country over the last eight years. I voted for Hillary Clinton�the least worst candidate. Fortunately, we get to vote again in four years. "
928,I think donald trump is all about himself and not the people of the country and that he does not even know how the average american lives. I think that hiliary clinton has a better grasp of the everyday american.
929,"I support Hilary Clinton because I know she has been working in politics for years, she has experience. I disagree with a lot of her policies and issues, and think there are significant problems with her campaign, but Donald Trump scares me and I think his policies would severely set America back in progress to the extent that I would strongly considered leaving the United States for my safety. "
930,"Hillary is a liar! Thump is a kind of crazy, but he will be the one people vote. Because we don't have any other choices."
931,"Honestly, DT is a wild card. I am not sure if he is in it for his own self interests or he would be truly helpful. I am fairly certain HC does not care about people like myself. I lean for towards democratic though I am an independent. I was a big bernie sanders supports. Thus it is tough for me, but while I disagree with both candidates on many issues (agree with each on some as well) I am willing to take a chance with trump, as I will not under any circumstances vote for clinton. "
932,Hillary seems dishonest and Trump is a loudmouth.  
933,"I think Trump is arrogant and a bully.  I think Clinton is dishonest, corrupt, and power-hungry.  I dislike both.  But I have to vote for Trump because I disagree with Clinton on many policies including her tax policies, desire to raise the minimum wage, abortion, and immigration policies."
934,i think donald is smart and honest. i think hillary is crooked and a liar. 
935,"I feel that Donald Trump is a refreshing, hopeful choice I believe he can bring about real change. I feel that Hillary Clinton would take us backward. I view her as a typical career politician, that puts her interests first."
936,"I think that Hilary is not the best candidate for the presidency, but she has a platform that is supported by facts and actual plans to fix things. Trump chooses to attack others, incite violence, encourage racial tensions, and feeds off of it all. He doesn't have much of a platform and lies very often."
937,"I feel that none of the candidates are suitable choices.  Hillary has far too many questionable actions.  I believe Trump to be a decent businessman but I'm not certain he has the necessary skills to be president.  Johnson and Stein haven't had enough exposure to make any real informed decision,  with Stein getting even less exposure than Johnson. "
938,I believe both candidates are extremes in directions I would not go. The fact that there is only 2 candidates leaves me throwing away my vote for the independent party.
939,"I wish there was a real good choice, they are both pretty bad"
940,"Both candidates have quite a bit of mistrust coming from people. This is the saddest part,m the fact that people will have to elect and vote for people they don't believe in. Saddest part is that one of the two will actually win. This election separate people, but also question the ""democracy"". How can we speak about democracy and not being able to have someone you believe in represent and defend your interests? "
941,both person very good
942,I do not feel I can trust Trump as a candidate. He lack of respect for ethnic groups and women are repulsive. He is to egotistical and power hungry and flip flops or lies throughout his campaign. I learned a lot about Trump over the past year and found he is worse then I had thought previously.  /  / Hillary Clinton has had to prove herself under way more scrutiny then any other presidential race I know about. the emails seem to be much about nothing. I have read through them before online what was released and not blacked out of course. The missing ones  not clear evidence of wrong doing and at this point I believe if their was anything really bad it would pale in comparison to Donald Trump and his unethical morally corrupt lifestyle past present future. 
943,Both candidates from the major parties are flawed. Unfortunately it comes down to picking the less of both evils. 
944,I don't think either one of them should be running for president
945,I think Hiliary is a liar. I think she has secret motives and is heavily influenced by higher powers of America. I believe Donald Trump is in it for the fame and money. But at least he isn't controlled by people
946,"I think most of the candidates are crooked, but some are more willing to try and make a change."
947,Trump is in it only for him self and cannot be trusted. I believe Clinton will be the best president the country has had since her husband. I believe most of her controversies have been trumped up by the Republicans and are not an issue.
948,"I think trump is dangerous he encourages a divide in our country he is a bigot a racist and misogynistic he bullies and mocks people, he is rude and not qualified to run our country. Clinton while not perfect by any means is well qualified she has handled scrutiny and insults throw at her in a very dignified manner and is at least understanding from how our government works."
949,Hillary is everything that is wrong with government. Trump is just the private sector version. Neither is a good choice and our country will be worse with either. 
950,Donald Trump is a man who is doing this solely because he loves his country . He does not need the money or the headaches. He genuinely loves this country whereas his opponent  has been on the take for the last 30 years . is so corrupt the fbi is afraid of her . Has never lowered herself to taking pictures with average people  unless of course they shell out $2800 a plate for her fundraisers.  There could not be a clearer difference . Truly a battle of good vs evil
951,"Trump has no political background, can't keep his mouth shut and Hillary is a liar that can't be trusted ever."
952,"Hillary Clinton is an exemplary candidate.  She has the ability and the experience to lead the country both in domestic and foreign policy.  On the other hand, Donald Trump is a self-absorbed candidate who has proven that he can agitate the darkest aspects and emotions of the Republican party into a mob-like frenzy.  He only  serves himself, and he would be the worst and most unqualified person to be president.  Hillary Clinton will serve all the people- not just those who supported her.  "
953,I do not favor Clinton or Trump.  However my state is a surefire Clinton state so I will be voting for the Green Party in the hopes of getting to the 15% votes needed in order to make it an officially backed party so that this god awful election scenario never happens again. 
954,Neither is very appealing at all and causes a lot of concern.  Hillary is who I chose but only because I see Trump as worse and not because I like her.
955,they are knowledgeable / they should worh hard for the development of the country and people
956,"I dislike both candidates to be completely honest. I think Trump is strictly a business man and is not suitable to run the country based on his political knowledge and planned ""surprises"" he keeps telling people about when it comes to how he will handle issues facing our country. I don't care for Hillary either and think she is in line with big dollars, but if it were between only her and Trump, I'd still pick her."
957,I don't feel either one can be trusted. They all seem to say one thing and then when they get elected do something else. Its just like voting for the least of the two evil.
958,I think Hillary Clinton is a huge liar and can not be trusted. Donald Trump tends to say controversial things but i believe that he has the country's best interest at heart.
959,"Trump is a racist, misogynistic, I'll-tempered, unqualified, subhuman.  Hillary is a qualified, experienced leader with the correct temperament for President.   There is no comparison between the two."
960,"I do not trust Hilary whatsoever.... She is a liar and criminal and should be treated as such the Clinton dynasty needs to stop. Trumps appeal is that he isn't a politician, but he does say things that I do not agree with and are offensive"
961,"I see in one a life times worth of self indulgence.  Trump has never engaged in public service, and is not likely to change. /  / I see in the other a life times worth of public service. Also, at her age not likely to change.  /  / So one can only assume that the one who has spent a life time of work in public service will actually devote a Presidency to the good of the public."
962,"I'm skeptical on both the candidates [that have a realistic chance at winning the election]. Trump seems very egotistical, and I assume it is because of his upbringing and businesslike nature. I agree with a few things he has talked about, but generally disagree with more. Clinton has the potential to be scary, but I think she might be a safer bet for this election."
963,"While I believe both canidates are below the typical ones, I still think Hillary is best. However, I would much prefer different presidential candates like bernie sanders"
964,Hillary is just a political machine. I can't take here seriously. / Donald is also awful but he has more of a business background 
965,I think Hilary Clinton has the expertise to become president while Donald Trump doesn't have that or even the temperament to do so. Gary Johnson is all of and I have no idea what the platforms of Jill Stein or Evan McMillin are.
966,Hillary is a globalist and cannot be trusted. Her clinton foundation is a criminal enterprise shich has taken advantadge of the nation of Haiti. SHe is a corrupt politician with global interests. Trump is a Naitionalist who is looking out for the county's best interests. He can be trusted to do what is right for the people
967,both candidates are very polarized in the ideology to where they are both very toxic and borderline dangerous.
968,"I don't trust Hillary Clinton for many reasons. I know Donald Trump has a big mouth, but he might be the one to get us out of debt. And he doesn't support abortion."
969,"I am voting for Hillary Clinton because she's smart and despite her faults I think she will do a way better job than Donald Trump. I think Trump is a bully and a liar and disrespects women. I think he would do a terrible job as president. I think both these candidates though, have been terrible to each other this election and no matter who wins I just want it to be over."
970,Trump is bad but Hilary is worse in my opinion. I would vote for the lesser of 2 evils.
971,"I believe that Trump wants whats best for the country. Clinton has a history of being untruthful of her actions. I do not believe that she wants what is best of the country, I believe that she is looking to make money and increase her power and control."
972,"I feel the two main candidates or an joke and an embarrassment.  If feel both main parties have really let us down this election, but unfortunately people are to stuck in their party line to really consider a 3rd party candidate."
973,"I think both candidates are undesirable. Both of them are liars, but Hillary's lies seem to be more serious when it comes to her being a candidate for president. However, Donald Trump just doesn't seem to have the correct temperament to be president. I also think that some of Donald Trump's views seem to be a little too extreme or not based in reality of what he can actually do. It's a lot easier to say ""I'm going to bring jobs back"" than to actually do it. It's also not very logical to think that we can somehow round up the millions of illegal immigrants in this country and ship them out. That isn't realistic, productive or helpful to our society. If people are here already and they don't have a criminal record here, there should be a path to citizenship for them. Perhaps there could stricter punishments for immigrants who engage in criminal activity, like jail and deportation, but to the peaceful immigrants already here, we should welcome them. They could help our economy if we work with them because there will be less of them working without paying taxes. I do agree with the author of the blog when he says that we don't want another Clinton in office. Hillary has been involved in this slowly degrading system for too long. She's too corrupted and will not make the changes that our country needs. She says she will help the middle class, but her past actions show that she doesn't really care about the middle class. Actions speak louder than words. I think most of us are ready for a fresh start in this country and want a new 'non-traditional' politician, but Trump isn't the right outsider to do this. So it's a lose-lose situation. "
974,Both candidates have flaws.
975,"I don't think Trump is a good candidate for president, I am not fond if how he talks about women. I think Clinton is a better candidate, she has a political background, and cares about the people."
976,"I honestly dont have any idea about both of them , they both seem very inappropriate for the job."
977,"donald trump will destroy our country. Hillary at least knows what she's doing, even if neither of them are honest. "
978,"I don't like either fully, however if I had to pick it would be Hillary Clinton.  Donald Trump is very self centered and an idiot.  I fear that if he becomes president, our country will go downhill."
979,"I think in this election people have been given a choice between the lesser of two evils. Clinton is slightly better than Trump but only by a little. Bernie Sanders would have been a far better choice and in the upcoming years, i think the democratic party will realize the mistake they have made but pushing Sanders out. "
980,Trump provides new hope for things that I care about.  He's willing to say and do things that he feels are right regardless of whether or not they are PC.  He isn't perfect but he's a refreshing change.  Hillary is extremely corrupt and can't be trusted with our country.  She will say absolutely anything to get votes and in the end will only do what's best for her and her family.
981,"Hillary Clinton has some skeletons in her closet, but she at least is qualified to serve as President and has some real plans to move the country forward. / Donald Trump is a train wreck who never should have made it this far. / Gary Johnson is a well-meaning individual who is too optimistic about free markets, and who isn't suited for a presidential role. / Jill Stein panders to too many loony ideas."
982,"Trump is vile and a little crazy. He is not very smart and contrary to his cultivated image is not a good business person. Clinton is at least smart, able, and not crazy. "
983,I believe that Hilary cares for people who are less fortunate. She wants to provide healthcare and free college tuition for people. /  / Trump does not seem terribly concerned with others less fortunate than himself
984,Im actually really confused on who i want to vote for. I do not want hilliary as commander. She is a evil person. She started off with good intentions but lost her way. The emails prove that. Im leaning more twords donald trump. He isnt the best option but at this point he is the only option. Even tho i feel like im failing my brothers and sister in the lgbt community because of pence. Its basic human right being violated. In honesty i wanted burnie. But since i couldnt have him my next option would be jill stein but again i wouldnt want my vote  to be wasted because she wouldnt win at this point in the election so its donald trump.
985,"Donald Trump is in the election, and everything, for himself. He is extremely polarizing and if you disagree with him over the smallest things he was basically try to crush you. Then again, if your interests are aligned, he will stop at nothing to help you achieve your goals and needs. /  / Hillary Clinton would make a monopoly out of the Oval Office. I think this is beyond terrible for the image we want to send to the rest of the world. I also do not trust her in the slightest, and she is very poor at making personal connections with her voters. /  / In general, this election has to be between two of the most unlikable candidates in a very long time. "
986,cant decide now who i am going to vote after that propaganda
987,"I do not trust both Hillary and Trump. They are both liars. Where Trump is rather silly with what he spouts, though I definitely do not approve of the allegations of him sexually harassing women, Hillary also has dark things in her past. Neither of these are good. Both seem dangerous, but I do believe that while people may laugh at Trump, Hillary is the more dangerous because she's a better actor or is good at hiding the fact that she is."
988,"As a military spouse, I am bias towards the candidate who will treat our military vets right. "
989,"Donald Trump intrigued me at first. I liked the idea that he was not a standard politician and was supposedly using much of his own money to finance his campaign. However, his words rely less on facts and more on either fear mongering or appealing to the general desires of right wing radicals. I don't trust him, and I wouldn't trust him to make the right decisions as president. /  / At first I didn't care for Hillary because she doesn't seem very sincere. There is a lot of propaganda against her based in enough fact to worry me (email server, Benghazi to name a few). However she is more competent than any other candidate running including Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. I don't think she is perfect, but she would be a good figurehead on the world stage. /  / I wanted to like Gary Johnson, and even though I like his policy on military use, I don't find him to be competent. I tried to like him but will choose Hillary. /  / Jill stein has interesting views, but I haven't found her background to be compelling enough to merit a presidential office. I also find her to be incompetent. "
990,"I think Trump runs everything like he runs a business, he is a business man, after all. Which would be okay, except given his track record. He hasn't exactly proven competent OR trustworthy. His methods seem almost dictatorial in nature, and he inspires violence and hatred among groups. He is in it all for himself, and does not seem to care or even think about the consequences of his leadership ethics and behaviors. Hillary Clinton is shady and equally untrustworthy, but she has experience, and she is at least QUALIFIED for this job.  Either way, i do not think the American people should just bow down to whatever leader is elected. We, as a people, must demand and take part in the changes we wish to see. "
991,"Hilary is a crook and a liar, and a Democrat. Have to stick with Trump."
992,I don't really have much views. I just feel like Trump is in it for the wrong reasons. While Hillary is actually trying to make a difference. 
993,Donald Trump is a superlative-adjective abusing salesman. / Hillary Clinton is a career politician saying anything to get elected. 
994,"I think Donald Trump is a horrible person in general, not to mention that he is basically the opposite of qualified to run our country. It will be completely embarrassing for our country if he is elected. Hillary Clinton has experience and will be a great President if given the chance. "
995,"Hillary is not my favorite person by any means, but she at least fights for social equality. Donald Trump is a hate-filled man-child who I wouldn't trust with making me a sandwich, let alone running my country."
996,"Hillary is a crook and a liar and is only out for herself,Trump my be out for the rich but I think he really wants to change this country for the better"
997,"I also believe Hillary Clinton would make the better president is she perfect no but she represents the little people and families and that show a lot of character as far as I am concerned. We need  someone who will stand up for the average Joe and not be all about themselves or others like them, She has a history in government that is important."
998,I despise Trump. He only cares about himself and is pandering to the uneducated southern conservatives. Clinton represents the people and I really like her.
999,"I do not like either candidate. I feel like Trump is a 12 year old rich jock that simply is unfit for the presidency. /  / I do not like Hilary Clinton because she's never been honest on her positions, virtually every position she claims to have supported all her life have been flip flopped on for her whole career. Much of her words claim to represent peace while many of her actions pushed us towards more war. I feel like she'd be competent in the job as a career politician unlike Trump who is simply unfit for the job and that's the only reason I'd vote for her in favor of Trump. Both are terrible however."
1000,THEY BOTH STINK
1001,I dont care about politics
1002,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is a very corrupt politician. She has committed criminal acts as should be held legally responsible. He social views are not as bad as every other thing about her, but it is hard to see such a small positive with a person like her. Donald Trump is a candidate that breaks the mold and will challenge what has become accepted politics.  He is learning the best policies and integrated his finance and business knowledge."
1003,Hillary Clinton belongs in prison. She is so corrupt and evil. Donald Trump has America's best interest in mind. He is ending the political correctness that is destroying our country.
1004,"Hillary is corrupt, is only interested in using the Presidency to make money and gain political power for herself, and is willing to do or say anything to achieve that goal. Trump is a rhetorical moron, and literally anyone else, even myself, could have done better in the debates or made fewer stupid gaffes that brought him negative attention, but he's not campaigning for president to gain money or power: he already is a billionaire, and has a whole lot of power as one of America's most famous and successful businessmen. He doesn't have to run for president, but he believes that he can make America great again."
1005,I really do not like any of the options. I would have loved to see Bernie Sanders as our president.
1006,I feel that Donald Trump will bring change that America needs right now to stand together.  Things are not doing so well and Clinton will just be more of the same.  I'm interested to see what happens and excited for the election.
1007,This election has been exhausting to endure because of Donald Trump. He is not fit to be president. Hillary Clinton is the obvious choice even with all the controversies.
1008,"I didn't vote for Clinton in the primaries, but I will vote for her in the general election because she is a much better, more stable choice than Trump is. I may be voting for Hilary just to not support Trump, but I really can't handle the possibility of him becoming president."
1009,Hillary Clinton flat out is a career politician and a power hungry evil person. Trump is an outsider who hopefully will shake things up.
1010,"I'm appalled people will vote for Hillary based on her sex. That's as wrong as voting for Barack because he's half black. We're supposed to vote for people based on qualifications, not skin color or gender. Both of these positions are racist and sexist themselves yet these are the jerks lecturing everybody else about being racists and sexists! Too many Americans have failed utterly in their duty to be good citizens instead of ideologues or dummies lapping up TV propaganda. "
1011,"I think we have the worst choices in history in this election period. Hilary will continue what Obama did which was not the best for our country. Donald Trump doesn't know much about how the government works, he's a hot head who can't keep his mouth shut,I'm sure he will make us have even more debt based on the fact of all the times he has filed for bankrupt. We're in a lose-lose situation who ever we vote for it's going to bad vote. All the good candidates lost_ in the first round now where left with a baby killer (Hilary) and the village idiot (Donald)  "
1012,"I think that Donald Trump is a joke and his supporters don't have anything to go by except buzzwords and conspiracy theories. Trump has no actual plans and his supporters believe any conspiracy theory they read, ie Hillary being part of the occult or running a child ring. Hillary actually has knowledge on how politics work and this ""outsider knows best"" nonsense is ridiculous in regards to Trump."
1013,i think trumps bigotry is unpresidential
1014,"donald trump will bring change, hillary will leave us stagnant."
1015,"Both major party candidates are terrible, but they reflect our divided nation.  We need to spend more time really researching both sides of every argument and respecting the other side's opinion.  We need to demand more out of the major parties and give more of a voice to 3rd and 4th party candidates."
1016,"Donald Trump is a complete moron who should not be running for president, and the fact that he has gotten this far is terrifying. The fact that he has the support of so many people is equally terrifying. Many of my friends and family support him, and I cannot understand that. He does not represent America. He is completely inept and will be the worst president our nation has seen. His fans are upset with Obama's ""failure to have done anything in the past 8 years,"" yet they disregard all of his accomplishments and neglect the fact that Congress is dominated by Republicans that prohibit Obama from carrying out his plans. Clinton is not my ideal candidate, but she is much more qualified for the job. I do not have to worry about her tweeting asinine insults toward other world leaders when she gets her feelings hurt over something. She is more calm and level-headed. Of course, her views also are more in line with mine."
1017,Donald Trump is a disaster waiting to happen / Hillary Clinton is an inept politician
1018,"Clinton is experienced, considerate and intelligent whereas Trump is careless inconsiderate and does not have leadership skills"
1019,Saduccee and Pharisee
1020,"I actually agree with most of what the author wrote. The idea of Donald Trump as president is scary to me. He is extremely unqualified and a megalomaniac. He has no business in charge of our country. Hillary has certainly made mistakes, as have all people. However, her experience and knowledge make her a much better candidate. I feel that she would make decisions that were best for our country. "
1021,"I don't like either of the candidates (Clinton vs. Trump), at this point I think it is voting for someone who will do the less damage to America, that being Clinton. Regardless, neither candidate will make a good president. "
1022,Donald Trump is a sociopath of the highest order. Hillary is not perfect but she is more capable of being president than Donald Trump who is liable to make an executive decision on an impulse.
1023,"I'm voting for Hillary clinton because I feel she is the lesser of two evils.  Donald Trump has no political experience whatsoever.  I think he's biting off more than he can chew.  He also scares me with some of his policies.  He wants to ban all muslims from entering the country and I think that is opening up a real big can of worms.  I also feel he's mostly looking out for himself and his rich friends.  He doesn't care about me, the lower class."
1024,"In my opinion Hillary Clinton should not be the candidate for the Democratic party.  She should be in prison for putting our country at risk with compromising confidential emails. She is also very cozy with ISIS ridden countries and has received large sums of money from these nations through her foundation.  She may say that Donald Trump hates women, but no one hates women as much as Hillary Clinton.  She has mistreated every woman her husband slept with and pays women in her foundation significantly less than her male counterparts.  I am very disappointed by the Democratic party that this was the best option. I am supporting Trump.  He is smart enough to turn our country around and there is something refreshing about a candidate who says what the rest of America is thinking."
1025,"Donald Trump is unique among modern presidential candidates, and is frightening. I feel very strongly that he is the most dangerous candidate and, were he to be elected, the USA and the world would be at a serious risk. Hillary Clinton is more liberal than many give her credit for, but is typical of the center-right American politicians that are produced by the Democratic party."
1026,"I believe that hilary clinton has the most experience, she needs to be watched so that she keeps the platform thats mainly based off of bernie sanders views when she becomes president. Hate donald trump."
1027,"Neither candidates are what I had hoped for. They both express views I don't agree with, either at all, or entirely. And I guess if I had a better choice, I would not vote for Hilary, but because she is against Trump, can't let him win, so I'll be voting against him."
1028,"Trump is an egocentric person who only does things for his own brand.  I do not believe he is running to help the common person, or even the less well off person, but rather for the wealth whom he can pick an choose to create connections with. /  / Hillary on the other hand cannot be trusted with keeping secrets, or maintaining a balance between personal an political life. I believe she is chasing a dream she's always had, but is not the best person suited or the job."
1029,"I feel that Trump does not have the temperament necessary to be president. While I dont completely trust Hillary Clinton, at least she has the necessary temperament to make decisions best for the nation."
1030,"I feel that Hillary is a criminal that should be in jail and she is going to slowly take away our freedoms and the middle class. Trump is a terrible person, but would be something different in office and would help appoint officials in office with the same views as me."
1031,"Even though Hillary has flaws and baggage, she has the best intentions for our country.  I do not fear that she may over react to some minor incident and put the United States in extreme danger, as I am afraid Donald Trump would do."
1032,"Donald Trump is a bigot, a bully, a misogynist and an egotistical human. He is the worst person to represent this country. /  / Hilary Clinton, although not perfect, has worked for the people for over 30 years. She's gotten many things accomplished, and she stands for beliefs that are important to me. She is the better candidate by a landslide. "
1033,I really don't dislike either on a personal level... This election cycle has been so polarizing.  I simply voted based on their respective tax plans.  I do think the Clinton's Foundation is an issue as well as he sloppiness re: classified info on her private e-mail server.  The are both pounding trigger rhetoric that does not match up well with decent policy regardless of their respective ideological differences.  Trade is a non issue. Trump know this.  The TPP isn't really a trade structure as much is it is a copy write protection treaty. GATT structure is already in place and decent. Anyways this election is a train wreck.  Either candidate will make a decent president.  
1034,Hillary lies and does the opposite of what she says. She is out for her family only and her record as well as email leaks show that. Trump I think started initially for attention but the attacks led him to see the corrupion involved and led him to believe he can be the outsider to force change. Due to her being under investigation for the 4 years of her term you simply cannot have her in there as well as the fact that based on email leaks she should not have been allowed to run to begin with. If Michelle Obama was the female to run I would have went her way but she didn't and we have a criminal running so I'm going Trump
1035,"I think every single politician is ""in it for themselves"". The LEAST of these evils is Gary Johnson... so I do believe I'll HAVE to vote for him. Just so I can sleep at night... until the A-bombs start dropping that is. "
1036,"I think both are equally as bad. Hilary is only a safer choice because she is not unpredictable. Trump would change our economy around because he is  business man and not a politician. However, Hilary lies so they both have there faults."
1037,"I feel they are both corrupt. Trump is a narcissist and Hilary is a carbon copy of everything that is wrong with the government. Bureaucracy is always in it, first and for most, for themselves. If the people they govern benefit, it was purely coincidental.  "
1038,"Donald Trump is a demigod who cannot be trusted to look out for anyone but himself. He has no plan, no foundation and will not only set this country back decades, he will destroy our place in the world. /  / Hillary Clinton is an extremely experienced candidate who will look out for the best interests of this company. We will continue to progress with equality in not only laws but economics."
1039,Hilary Clinton is the best choice though she could be more transparent. Donald Trump as president will be a complete disaster and I might move abroad. 
1040,"Hillary Clinton is an honest, loyal, patriotic citizen and is the most qualified candidate to ever seek the presidency.  /  / Donald Trump is a lying, disloyal charlatan that has failed in nearly every venture he's engaged in, and shouldn't be allowed to visit the white house for a tour let alone occupy it. "
1041,Hilary has been in politics for awhile. She cannot be trusted whatsover. Her interests are in the hands of lobbyists and banks. I fear trump will only hold interest for big buissness. What I do like about Trump is he isn't afraid to say how he feels. For the most part he seems genuine in helping this country.
1042,"In spite of what this left wing blinder-wearing bozo wrote, Hillary Clinton may be well suited for political office compared to a man with no political background, but my god, her moral fiber is wrought with evil. She's involved in Satanism, Child Trafficking, Sex Magic, you name it. Source: 48,000 released Emails that you can view and read yourself. /  / Oh. Trump didn't release his tax returns because he LEGALLY took a loophole to save hundreds of millions of dollars for him shareholders and he knew media would blow it out of proportion. / Yeah, he said ""P**SY"" 10 years ago too, well Mr. Clinton has sex with minors a lot, against their will. / Anyone that votes for Hillary is asking for a bullet."
1043,"I am leaning toward voting for Hilary Clinton because I agree with most of her platform, but there has been a lot of scandal surrounding her. I feel like we don't have a good choice in this election.  I would rather vote for Bernie Sanders.  Donald Trump is terrifying.  "
1044,"I think they are all terrible candidates and I am embarrassed that the rest of the world views them as our representatives. Hillary is dishonest and Trump, among other things, is a terrible chauvinist with his head in the sand when it comes to politics. My thoughts are at least Hillary has experience and she might have a slim chance of being cordial and making allies with other countries. "
1045,"I do not trust Hillary Clinton. She is controlled by high finance self interest groups and has no moral compass. I do not personally like Donald Trump; however, I believe America needs a leader who is not your typical politician who is out for his or herself. We need a leader who truly has the best interest in our country at heart."
1046,"While I did not advocate for Hillary Clinton in the primaries, I feel that she is far more adequate of a choice to be Commander-in-Chief than her opponent, Donald Trump. While I do not discredit third party candidates, I do not view either of the third party choices as more qualified nor do I believe that they have a chance at upsetting the vote enough to change the outcome. "
1047,"I think Hillary Clinton was following the example of her predecessors in using private email and it's a non-issue as she has admitted her mistake and apologized for it. As for the issues concerning her husband's infidelity and misbehavior with other women - supporting him is her prerogative as his wife and it is up to him and his accusers to pursue any legal action necessary.   / I think Donald Trump is an arrogant misogynistic woman abuser and child molester who uses extreme tactics to put down any complaints. He displays classic abusive behaviors, including the denying and deflection of fault. He will not admit his errors and instead blows up with angry vehemence. I think women in this country are due for a major shock if he gets elected as he will undo all the progress made in the last century. "
1048,"pro Trump, anti Clinton"
1049,"I think they are both bad candidates. This election has been a joke. I do not support either of them. I voted for Gary Johnson. If I absolutely had to pick trump or clinton, I suppose I would choose clinton."
1050,I think Donald Trump is a joke. Hilary is the lesser of the two evils. 
1051,"I have been a Republican for 35 years, and this election cycle I support Hillary Clinton 100%. I think Donald Trump is a disgrace and an embarrassment to this country.  If he is elected it will be a disaster for us all.  Although I have not always thought well of her politics or her policy, Secretary Clinton has the knowledge, experience, and temperament to lead this country."
1052,"I feel Donald Trump has the right attitude, to help the people. I feel Hillary Clinton is more in it for herself. She's had years to show us what she can do and all that come about are lies and scandals. She probably dies mean well but to me hasn't shown it enough. "
1053,"While neither is ideal, because no one takes the time to nominate and fight for reasonable candidates anymore. But, I am seeing Trump in a more favorable light than Clinton."
1054,Hillary for prison.  / Make America great again. 
1055,I am voting for Trump because i don't want a criminal like Hillery in office! Too much crimes she has committed and new info coming out about her tie to raping children! 
1056,"I have seen much deliberation over the personal, moral, political and social issues that affect the core of our country.  I believe that Donald Trump is shing a light on the things that require our attention and he will move this country back toward a Consitutional Republic.  He has my vot."
1057,I think Trump isn't a born enough leader to know how to run the country.  I also think Hilary is unfit to be in charge as well.
1058,"In all honesty, I don't really care for either one of them. I feel that Hillary Clinton has the knowledge and experience to do the job right, while Donald Trump really knows very little about running a country. He is very immature and that's not a good trait to have when given such a huge responsibility."
1059,"I have lived through enough misery having to tolerate and suffer through the failed administrations of the clinton's with all their corruption and criminal activity for 8 years, on with another wasted 8 years of obama humiliation to where all that fool has ever done is drive our country into the ground in a fully deliberate manner, all the while apologizing to our opposition for things we should honor with pride! The list goes very deep and extensive into the factual reality of events which have continually poisoned the country people like me have fought for. I can't take any more of this liberal fanaticism which demoralizes our country's values at every turn. I am not proud of where today's Republican party is heading by any regard, as they are losing track of what they represent very quickly. Donald Trump is a total outsider who tells it like the real American's know it to be true. He is exactly as you see him and I don't care if he hurt some pathetic liberla feelings. My concern is for the strengthening of this country and the security of my home, now and in the future. Donald Trump is the ONLY chance left for that to be possible. Clinton will continue to sell out our country and then sell off the scrap of our remains to the highest bidder for her personal gain. What she doesn't destroy personally, she will passively stand by to allow ISIS to destroy the rest without any concern at all. Obama has brought us to the brink of destruction. Clinton will insure that she finishes the job by closing the lid on America's coffin. A VERY LETHAL MISTAKE!!!"
1060,I do understand somewhat where the author is coming from. We do need a candidate who is not friends with the wall street bankers and who relies on their money to win. But Donald Trump is not that person. If it were someone else who is at least knowledgeable in politics i would consider it. But this man is only out for himself and the wealthy. The only politics he knows is how to turn the laws in his favor. Because of this is why i vote for Hillary Clinton. She at least knows what our government is all about and has been working in it for over 30 years. Anyone who can withstand the brutality that has been forced on her certainly has my vote.
1061,"Hillary Clinton just can't tell the truth ""I can't recall"" seems to be her favorite answer to every question. If she is having memory problems she shouldn't be president. Plus it will be embarassing to have our first female president criminally charged and prosecuted. Donald Trump really needs to watch what he is saying."
1062,"1) Jill Stein is the best choice. She wants to boost the economy, make sure there is no more hunger or thirst, all while saving the environment. /  / 2) Gary Johnson is the 2nd best choice. He is  fairly intelligent and conservative. /  / 3) Donald Trump is the 3rd best choice. He is a real estate investor and television celebrity who hosted and created NBC's ""The Apprentice"" /  / 4) Hillary Clinton is the worse choice, she is the ex first lady of the United States, ex- New Your U.S senator and U.S Secretary of State. She is an airhead and will do anything in the name of  money, wealth and fame. /  / "
1063,"I think Hillary is experienced, and cares about the American people, while Donald a Trump cares about no one but himself. Trump will not make a good president."
1064,Donald Trump is dangerous. He will destabilize the economy and does not know how to or have the inclination to lead this country. Hillary isn't an exciting candidate but at least she isn't going to destroy the country.
1065,"When Trump was first nominated, I thought he might be an honest, refreshing change from the usual political representatives. As time went on, he has shown he is not fit to be President. There are many things I don't like about Clinton, but at this point she is probably the lesser of the two evils. Either way, I am not voting for either. If I do decide to vote, it will likely be for Johnson."
1066,"I believe that voting for Donald Trump is a vote for hate, and repression of certain people. We need a candidate who inspires hope, and promotes equality, not hateful rhetoric. "
1067,Hillary Clinton is a lying liar who lies.  Donald Trump is a bigoted asshole.  Pick your poison.  I choose not HIllary.
1068,"hillary is a crooked, lying, elitist, that has no integrity and cannot be trusted in any capacity.  Donald is a buffoon, a gorilla, and egotist, but he is an HONEST buffoon, gorilla, and egotist.  I'm through with politically correct candidates, whether republican or democrat."
1069,Clinton has committed crimes and should be held accountable and should not be allowed to even run for president.  Trump is an outsider and might be what we need to change things.
1070,Hillary Clinton has more experience than Donald Trump  
1071,"I think they are both poor candidates. Hillary is untrustworthy, and Donald is to cavalier with his opinions and that makes other people misunderstand him."
1072,"I'm not a fan of Hillary by any stretch, but she's fundamentally competent and qualified to run our country. Donald Trump is not and I feel he would set forward a number of policies and enactments which would have a disastrous long-term effect on this country. I think Donald Trump in many ways would represent the official decline of this country. "
1073,"Trump is a Godzilla-like monster who is unqualified to be a candidate for President.  His supporters favor xenophobia, racism, greed, violence, anger, resentment, ignorance, propaganda and corruption. /  / Ms. Clinton represents the kind and caring nation that America embodies, where equality, generosity, education, healthcare, peace and prosperity for all are fundamental characteristics.  "
1074,While I agree that Hillary is far from perfect I think Trump would be a disaster for this country. Not only do I feel he would have a hard time working with other and taking their opinions I to consideration I think he would greatly harm foreign relations. I also think his negative views on so many subsets of our country will further devide us. 
1075,"Donald trump is an egotistical maniac, has no substance, and no consideration, and I don't know a lot about Hilary Clinton except she seems like the mean grandmother you don't really want around but you have to put up with..."
1076,This is a very hard election Trump has some ok ideas as does Hillary 
1077,"While Trump has had no  government experience, Clinton has had an ample amount as First Lady, Senator and then Secretary of State. I do not agree with Trump's statements about non white citizens i.e., latinos, muslims, etc. and I certainly do not agree with the way he looks at women. That is enough for me to  NOT vote for Trump. What is important, are the reasons to vote FOR Clinton. Her past history indicates that she had a true feeling for children and women's rights since she worked as an advocacy for them for many years, and traveled the world as First Lady along with Chelsea to campaign for women's rights in other countries. She also has ties with various country leaders as Secretary of State and has an understanding of foreign issues which is very important for our country at this time, due to all the unrest. Our economy has definitely improved from the Bush debacle under Obama's presidency but we still have much to do to create jobs and I think Clinton is the one to carry this forward by setting in motion action of climate change and, thus, create many new clean energy jobs."
1078,I don't like either candidate but I think there's too much at stake right now to elect a ticking time bomb like Donald Trump. 
1079,"Unlike Trump, Clinton is in favor for women's rights and also the rights of the minorities. Trump has proved to be vulgur and biased. "
1080,"Not one candidate has cover and issue that is particularly close to me.  My situation at hand is not being addressed by anyone and because of how it's handled, or NOT handled, I am afraid to even speak on it.  Though my statement is vague in it's specific topic, the current state of the country and world makes it all worse.  Housing, Social Security, Homeland Security, International tensions, Education...  All anyone can do is wait and see and that is truly frightening. "
1081,"Donald Trump is a horrible example. Unfit to be president. Hillary Clinton is a liar. She has made a lot of mistakes, but admits them. The other candidates are okay but a wasted vote. Third parties never win."
1082,I think Hillary can realay help the lower and middle classes while making the rich pay a more fair share. While trump is hot head and is temper could be very dangerous and he cares more about himself and the rich
1083,I believe in giving Donald Trump a shot.  We all know Hillary's track record and past mistakes and some of them are just unforgivable.  I think she's in it for herself and for the wrong reasons.  I will be voting for Trump and giving him a shot and hoping he's as good as president as he is running his businesses day to day.
1084,Trump is a gre as the candidate I believe in his views and his stand point. Hillary is corrupt and dangerous for our country 
1085,Trump knows what he wants to do. He knows business and he can get what needs to be done that needs be done. Hillary wants us to  be dependent on Government so that we can put in one world Government. Both candidates mean so much different. 
1086,"I honestly believe we, as a country, are screwed either way. I am voting for Donald Trump because of his views against mandated vaccines and how he isn't afraid to go after what he thinks is right. He isn't afraid to tackle things head on, himself. I used to like Hillary Clinton, but she has drastically changed since her husband was in office and she is just a liar. She is corrupt, bought out, and selfish."
1087,I don't trust mister Trump. / I hope Hillary Clinton will be our next president.
1088,"Both are liars, but Trump is too chaotic and evil. Hillary is old school corruption but more predictable and safe."
1089,Both are total shit in different ways. 
1090,"Trump is scary because he does not know how to communicate and cooperate with others. The idea that he is watching out for the middle class is hilarious, since he is a rich man who has no concept of how real people live. There are a lot of things I dislike about Clinton, but she has a record of representing her people, negotiating, and when necessary, compromising for mutual benefit. "
1091,I honestly hate Trump. I disagree with how he's going to run the country as well as his attitude in general. He is so stuck on himself. He cannot even run his businesses correct so I don't understand how he thinks he will run a country right.
1092,"Hillary has the experience.She has a good heart, even though she has made mistakes. She has the intelligence and strength to get things done. She has done a remarkable job as first lady and Secretary of State. / Donald has a background in business, a large part of which was a failure. He has clearly demonstrated that he is a racist misogynist and I despise the way he treats and speaks of women. He has no background in matters of state or politics, and is completely unsuited intellectually and temperamentally for the job of POTUS."
1093,i think they are both a mess i really hope something changes for the better and hope that in 4 years we have better candidates
1094,Clinton is an insider and career politician. Clinton is owned by the Wall Street banksters. / Trump is a political outsider who will shake things up inside the DC Beltway.
1095,"Hilliary Clinton seems like she lies constantly to cover up more lies and really doesn't care what people think.  She lives in her world where rules don't matte and she just doesn't care, she only cares about herself.  Trump seems rough around the edges and I wouldn't be suprised to find out he was bullied when he was younger.  His heart and brain are in the right place, but sometimes the words don't come out right."
1096,I feel like Trump is going to bring us war. There is nothing good about him. Clinton may have some bad points to her but her good points outweigh them
1097,"Donald Trump is a liar a con man and mentally ill, i believe. Hillary Clinton is experienced, educated and just an all around better candidate."
1098,Trump has been a pop culture icon for thirty years and is only now being outed as a racist and a sexist.  The Clintons have been in some form of power for over thirty years and have perpetually been under investigation of some kind.  Johnson does not appear to be fully mentally stable in some aspects.  I will cast my vote for crass over corrupt or crazy in regards to the safety and security of our nation.
1099,"Trump seems to have good policies; however, his horrible outbursts and offhand comments completely ruin his stance. It takes away from what he is truly trying to do. Hilary Clinton has so many secrets and does not seem to appreciate middle or lower class people. I do not know much about the other candidates, but I wish that everyone would vote for a third party. Democrats and Republicans are not the only parties in existance."
1100,Trump is a racist.  That's all there is to it. He is an evil man and should have been kicked out of the running along time ago. this country is screwed if he wins the election.
1101,"Im still undecided im leaning a little more towards clinton but id say she would put us in world war 3 and trump is just a mess all around, i say bring bernie back."
1102,I think that they are both terrible choices. Hillary on one hand is a very stereotypical career politician  and Donald on the other is an ignorant buffoon. Even though i absolutely despise Hillary Clinton I think she is the lesser of two evils and unfortunately the better candidate for POTUS.
1103,"I feel that they both have their minuses, but Hillary Clinton is as corrupt as they get. I feel that she would take our country down a horrible path and remove traditional ideals once and for all. We should not live in a country where everybody deserves the same. It should be based on hard work and strong moral values."
1104,"Clinton has better views on disability than Trump. She has some decent views on autism, focusing more on acceptance than on treatment/curing. I'm glad she has brought disability into politics, since this is the first major election that it's being talked about. I don't like the way she speaks about people of color. I don't like her views on the Palestinian Genocide. To some extent, I'm voting for her because she's not Trump and her seeming commitment to disability.  /  / Trump scares me with his views on conversion therapy, women, people of color, disabled populations, Jews, Muslims, and really any marginalized and oppressed group. I can't vote for someone who in many ways is advocating for the deaths or further oppression of people like me. "
1105,"Hillary Clinton is competent, qualified, and intelligent.  I wish her record had less scandal, but I am confident in her ability to lead the country.   Donald Trump's experience in leadership is as a bully.  He mistreats everyone in his way.  I fear the alliances he will destroy, and the ones he will forge, and I fear for the treatment of everyone he considers ""less than"" and anyone who dares to speak up against him.  I believe he will destroy what national unity we have left AND make us an international target."
1106,"Hillary Clinton is a liar and cannot be trusted with confidential information. She also doesn't care about the troops. Trump has made mistakes with his money and his mouth gets him in trouble, a lot. "
1107,"I strongly oppose Donald Trump and believe that if he became the next president of United States, the country will be in great danger. I am not a very strong supporter of Hillary Clinton but I believe she is the better candidate of the two. "
1108,I am in no way a Trump supporter but I could never bring myself to vote for Hillary.  I hate that our political system only allows two candidates an honest chance at the presidency and I blame big business and special interest groups for that.  Hilary was found to be extremely careless in the actions that she took as Secretary of State but that is OK because she said sorry.  She knew what she was doing and has been a corrupt politician for years.  Trump has zero business being our president either but I will vote for him and hope that the House and Senate will do their part to be the checks and balances for his dumb ideas just like they have railroaded Obama for 8 years.
1109,"While I think they both have issues, I have more confidence in Hillary Clinton that she could get the job done based upon her experience. Donald Trump has no experience, and a horrible temperament and I feel as if he doesn't have a true understanding of the issues.  "
1110,do not support trump so have to support hillary even though she has done some questionable things
1111,I don't like either candidate. I don't like Hillary's views on abortion
1112,"I feel that Hilary is a typical politician, She is ambitious and bends the truth and is influenced by special interest groups who support her financially. She is also intelligent, knowledgeable and exceptionally qualified. / On the other hand, Donald Trump is unqualified and has not put in the work to be prepared or show that he cares. He is an egotistical, narrow-minded, racist, misogynistic, uninformed privileged white man who pretends to understand the needs of the populace but only acts out of self interest,"
1113,"I already voted early for Donald Trump.  Hillary Clinton is a lying piece of crap who is only out for her self-interest.  She doesn't care about this country and only about herself.  If she cared about this country she would not be willing to destroy it by allowing millions of illegals in especially from the Middle East who are going to try and take over and implement pyschotic and Sharia Law.  Also, she is partially responsible for the harm of our soldiers in Benghazi.  If she becomes president our country is in big trouble.  "
1114,"Donald Trump is an egotist pulling a fast one on his supporters. He is unstable and unfit to hold the most important office in the world. His lack of understanding and knowledge about the world he would be dealing with is unprecedented as well as his sense of moral judgement. He is out for himself and the world will suffer if he is elected. / Hillary Clinton is a lifelong politician with dozens of years of service who is not without her own baggage that we are all aware of even if many of the concerns about her are unfounded. Her lack of transparency and judgement at times is more than a bit questionable but, her concern for ordinary people is unquestionable. She is also the most prepared person to ever seek the office of President of the United States "
1115,I am extremely disappointed in both of them. I do not feel that either is honest or has the American people's best interest in mind. This election is truly an exercise in choosing the lesser of the evils. 
1116,"Trump acts like a child with a bad temper.  With his attitude, I am sure that our country will make many enemies and this is scary.  He will cause countries to want to go to was with us.  Hillary is just okay.  I would have preferred Bernie Sanders or Gary Johnson as president."
1117,I strongly support Hillary Clinton because of her ideals.
1118,I am not strongly impressed by Trump's behavior.  He acts like a two-year-old tantrum throwing child too often.   I hope and believe he will have enough strong people behind him to help move this country along in the right direction in spite of his character flaws.  I have absolutely no trust or belief in Clinton at all and believe her as president of this country would be a total disaster.  We would be on the same path we've been on for the past 8 years and this is not acceptable to me.  She cannot be believed or trusted in any way.  
1119,Donald Trump is really bad in his own way. So is Hillary. Hillary is slightly the lesser of two evils which is why I will vote for her.
1120,"I feel Donald J. Trump is a borderline sociopath who cares only about the self-promotion of Donald J. Trump. From his mocking of a disabled reported to the countless proven lies he has spoken, there is no way in heck I'd vote for him. Hillary Clinton on the other hand, is a skilled elder stateswoman who knows what she's getting into. She understands the issues and will continue the legacy of President Obama. I already voted for her with a smile on my face! "
1121,"I think something must be done to stop the constant investigations of Hillary Clinton.  Close the case and move on, FBI and Republicans.  Propoganda and misinformation is the Nazi way but too many people see through it now.  Hillary is being harrassed and will continue to be for the rest of her life if there is not some way to stop the endless, fruitless investigations.  I believe Donald Trump to be responsible for much of the misinformation as he feeds it to his supporters, knowing they won't seek the truth themselves."
1122,"Robert Miles captured it well. Hillary Clinton is untrustworthy and dangerous; she frightens me for the short and long term future of our country. Trump is not a perfect candidate either, however, I appreciate his candor and would much have someone honest in office than someone so shady as Hillary. I also agree with the majority of Trump's political and economic views."
1123,"I think that politicians and the candidates are dishonest people.  They are in it for themselves.  When their tenure as president is over, they go back to civil life, raise money for their libraries, and make enormous amounts in speaking fees.  They are millionaires before and after the election.  They lead different lives than the average American, and have a sociopathic need for power over others and to have control."
1124,I think Trump has America's best interest in mind.  On the other hand Hillary is a self-serving criminal.  She is looking out for just herself and her financial status.
1125,"First the third party candidates don't have a chance, so in order for my vote to count I have to pick, what I think, is the lesser of 2 evils.  In doing that I will choose Trump because I think Clinton should be in jail over the email mess she created, others who have done alot less are, and I think she became the democratic candidate through fraudlent means.  Greater of 2 evils, in my opinion.  Trump isn't much better with his smart mouth insulting everyone and know it all attitude, but prefer Pence as vice president then the democrat.   So the lesser of 2 evils"
1126,"I do not trust Hillary Clinton at all. I think that the is extremely crooked and corrupt. If she is president, she will continue the same destructive path that Obama has on and the country will continue to suffer. Trump may have his flaws, but he is honest and is the only one who can get the country back on track. "
1127,"One is a compulsive liar permapolitician and one isn't.   One is demonized because of 'mean things he's said', while the other has actually caused people to lose their life and has blatantly broken many laws and people seem to think the 2 points are actually comparable.  "
1128,"I won't be a cheerleader for either (Clinton or Trump). I think Clinton is a better choice because of how much time and experience she has being involved in higher levels of government. I don't have total faith or trust in her, but I think she's strong enough to handle the nastiness that will be lobbed her way. Trump has not shown himself to be credible, knowledgeable, or prepared to run a country. His attitude towards women and people of color is grotesque. He is a showman, and a very good one but he is not a President. I do not trust him at all."
1129,"While I don't completely agree with or love either candidate, I feel that Hillary Clinton is a better choice to represent and lead our country. Trump is unprepared, and a bit unpredictable. I think he is an embodiment of the stereotype American, how other countries see us - touristy, campy, loud, crass... Hillary can remain poised and professional, and her views more closely resemble mine in general."
1130,"Clinton is a lying corrupt woman who is only out for herself.  She has no concern for the citizens of this country except how they can serve her and make her wealthy.  She would be a dangerous disaster for the country. /  / Trump is a lying narcissist who only thinks of himself and how others treat him.  He would be a dangerous disaster for the country. /  / Neither of them know about or care about the Bill of Rights or Constitution of this Republic, the rule of law or justice.  "
1131,"Clinton is a career lair, with a history of corruption. Trump is a narcissistic RINO. I don't believe ether of them tells the truth about there beliefs and motivation."
1132,"They are both deeply corrupted and incorrigible as human beings, let alone as my political representation. Yet, the government is not about MY political representations but of corporate ones. We're in an oligarchy. "
1133,"Clinton has political experience, diplomatic skills & clearly favors building America from the ground up. / Trump is nothing more than a self-serving asshole."
1134,i lean a little bit more toward clinton especially in leu of trumps recent behavior
1135,"I honestly don't trust either of them. I'm not very educated when it comes to politics but, I do know they've both been caught doing illegal things, or are suspected of it. I didn't bother getting registered to vote this election because I feel like we are screwed no matter what we do. "
1136,"I have a dismal view of both candidates. Trump does and says things that are very unfavorable. He says a lot of things that contradict each other and may be sexist and inappropriate. But he's human. He does not pretend to be perfect. He has issues just like every other American. Sometimes I say contradictory things or say things I don't mean in the heat of the moment. Hilary is the opposite, but no better. She puts on an air of being perfect, and all about female rights, but underneath the table she is doing things like the email scam. I would rather have someone who has their dirty laundry aired than one who tries to hide everything."
1137,Hillary is a liar and very untrustworthy as most people in politics are. Donald Trump is not in politics and we need to give someone a try who is not.
1138,"The candidates may have their own interests, of course."
1139,"I think that Trump is being attacked and he has very good values with a plan that can help the country. On the contrary, Clinton is corrupt and is not being represented by her true plans and who is buying her candidacy. Bernie Sanders clearly won, but she got in as the nominee for the Democratic party. I think that we need a guy like Trump who really who really does care about this country. "
1140,I support Hillary Clinton because I think she will work for the betterment of our country and especially work for the American middle class people.
1141,I'm worried Hilary is a bit of a liar.  At least Trump seems honest.
1142,"Trump is the only thing we have standing against the evils of liberalism at the moment; he's not ideal, he's a phony to some extent, but he's all we have. Hilary Clinton is yet another monstrous liberal using criminals & illegal aliens to secure political power for herself, and work towards the leftist utopia where rich, privileged whites use minorities as shock troopers to get their revenge on the people who told them they weren't smart or pretty as kids, or whatever it is that drives the left wing scum."
1143,Hillary is a criminal at the heart of the establishment that is the majority of the problem in this country. Donald Trump is a selfish buffoon. 
1144,"I feel hillary has given us lots of help in the past, with her work for childrens health care throughout the nation.  I feel Donald has always and will always just be in this for himself, does not know how or even why to help other people."
1145,"Donald Trump is not the best. But I feel he is authentic. Hillary Clinton is the worst type of personality you can imagine. I think that she actually believes the lies that she tells. She cannot be trusted to say anything truthful. I do think that when she started out she may have been one of those ""idealistic political"" types she now criticizes Bernie Sanders supporters of being. Its funny how corrupt she has become. Maybe she should have stayed in her parents basement!  "
1146,I believe both Clinton and Trump have proven they are unfit to lead our country. While some of Hillary's policies align with my personal beliefs I do not think she actually believes or intends to implement a lot of things she says. She changes her stance to meet whatever political agenda she has at the moment and panders to whomever she is currently needing support from. Donald Trump is a bigoted racist who will only set back out country on social and foreign issues. Neither deserves my vote. I am hoping that the green party gains enough votes for funding in the next election cycle in order to break up our 2 party system.
1147,Both candidates are bad. We have no good choice.
1148,Hillary Clinton is a politician that can't be trusted. Donald Trump is an ego-maniac that is potentially dangerous
1149,"I'm not crazy about either of them, but I think that Clinton would be less damaging to the country than Trump. Clinton would maintain some sort of status quo, whereas Trump has the potential to damage relations with other countries and reverse progress for underrepresented groups (women, LGBT, Mexican Americans, etc.). "
1150,NA
1151,"I think Hillary is corrupt and is anti-American...she preaches all of this equality BS when she is anti-police, anti-white, anti-American...she loves everyone except Americans and is willing to compromise out security and well-being so she can boost per political power in other countries.  Trump doesn't always say the right things in the most appropriate ways, but he cares about getting America back on it's feet again and cleaning up the atrocious mess Obama left behind.  He is a businessman who will get our economy back on track."
1152,"Clinton is the epitome of what is wrong with politics, while Trump is the definition of what is wrong in America. I fear for this country- was these two seriously the best you could come up with to be the candidates?? There needs to be an established 3 party system, but the corruption and rigging of politics and the elections and the media makes that seem so much less possible than I thought was going to happen this election year with Bernie Sanders. He is the picture portrait of the people who are fed up with the way things are going and want more attention on the working class-well, he was...until he conceded to Clinton then disavowed his Bernie or Bust supporters.(which i happen to have had been one)"
1153,"Trump is unpredictable, racist, sexist, and would be terrible for our country. Clinton is the better of two options."
1154,I think Hillary Clinton is OK. She is basically the same we have had for a while. I think Trump is a dangerous bigot. I am afraid of his potential rise to power.
1155,"Hilary Clinton will make a terrible president, but I'd rather have a terrible president than a dictator elected into office.Donald Trump is an absolute lunatic and Hilary is a deceitful liar.  Hilary has the whole e-mail scandal. Trump is accused of child rape. Neither one is qualified to be fit for president and neither one should actually be permitted to run in the election."
1156,"Trump is a pompous, arrogant, xenophobic, racist, sexist, self-righteous man.  Hillary has lied but Trump will get us into war with foreign countries, I don't have that fear with Hillary."
1157,"Hillary Clinton is shady. But I also think she is competent and would not be detrimental to things like women's rights, the environment, or education. Donald Trump is a nightmare. God help us if he wins. It blows my mind anyone would vote for him. I wish Bernie was an option!"
1158,"I love how Donald trump is honest. He wants to put America first. He's against the free trade deal, abortion, and illegal immigration. Hillary is a liar, she should be in prison. "
1159,"Hillary is a career politician, but as someone who is very socially liberal I identify with her in that way.  Donald Trump is a disgusting, loud-mouthed, disrespectful, sexist person who knows very little about politics and knows a lot about bankrupting businesses.  Someone who has furniture made of gold is just not someone who can identify with me in any way, nor do I think he has any interest in doing so.  Honestly, I do not like the two party system.  This year has really made me see that.  I typically identify as an independent and vote by who is closest to my policy beliefs.  I don't like either main candidate, and I just wish that it was easier to adopt several new parties and candidates into the fold.  Other people that would actually somehow stand a chance at winning."
1160,"I would be scared for the country if trump becomes president. He has no idea how to speak with other leaders and he flies off the cuff if someone makes him angry. Hillary, while not my first choice, is much more suitable for the presidency. She stays calm and collected and knows hoe to speak with people. "
1161,"On the plus side, Hillary Clinton comes in with the widest mist diverse diplomatic, political, legislative public serve credentialed experience to our country of any candidate in my life time. On the down side she has some personal human limitations in terms of relatedness to the average American. Thia is balanced with the fact that she is a well known quantity.   /  / Donald Trump is a totally unpredictable character with profoundly self-involved short tempered  tendencies.  He comes in with the least public service credentials in my life time. All this could be forgiven, as far as I ma concerned had he released his tax record which he refused to do. I have never experienced this before. Hence he cannot be trusted with the country's treasury.  "
1162,"I think they are both bad candidates for presidency, but Hilary is a little less unpredictable than Trump"
1163,"I think Trump is an unqualified fuck face. How he got this far is beyond me. I only agree with about 65% or so of what Clinton wants to do, but she is light years more qualified than trump."
1164,"I don't think Donald Trump is much better than Hillary.  She seems to lie much more and then covers it up with more lies.  With Donald Trump, at least I can kind of see what I'm getting.  With Hillary Clinton, anything could happen.  Two very poor choices."
1165,I think Hillary is our only real option now. Trump is racist and has not had a career in politics so he has no idea what he is doing. Hillary has been in poltics and can at least lead us in some direction. 
1166,"Donald Trump is the cancer of this presidential campaign. I can understand the cry of the people who want to see a change to this nation's establishment, but voting for someone so unstable and extremely chaotic is not the way. He gives off false hope and people eat it up. It's nonsense. Hillary Clinton may not be my first choice, but it's what I feel is better for the nation. At least she is someone with extensive work experience when dealing with the American government. I will choose her over the destructiveness that is Donald Trump."
1167,"I think Donald is a little too boisterous and in seek of the presidential position just to prove he can get it -- not to actually take heed to the job itself in any way. /  / I think Hillary, however, has a sketchy political past, and may have the experience, but to what degree and how that can help is probably up for debate."
1168,"I believe Trump has good points in his plans for if he becomes president. He just isn't a great speaker and doesn't think before he talks. Both candidates are a little corrupt, so it's going to be a very close race. "
1169,"Today, Republican and Democratic voters express similarly low levels of satisfaction with the field of candidates: 40% of Republicans and Republican leaners, and 43% of Democrats and Democratic leaners, say they are very or fairly satisfied with the selections"
1170,"I feel Hilary Clinton is a much better choice than Donald Trump, but I will not be voting for either on election day. I will be voting for Gary Johnson to take a stand in the voting process in America. Smaller, more unknown candidates never get an opportunity to get their voice heard like the two candidates from the major parties. This system needs to be changed, big banks and business need to get their lobbyists and money out of Washington. Instead of paying millions of dollars to avoid taxes or pay for legislature that helps them, they should spend that money in order to innovate and play the game. Bernie Sander's vision needs to become a reality."
1171,"Donald Trump represents to me a new beginning, and at the same time a return to things that once made us great -- such as American companies hiring American citizens rather than leaving the country, and not hiring illegals. In addition, I am excited at the idea of getting rid of people who disrespect our laws by living here illegally and siphoning off of our system. Hillary wants to give these people amnesty and let them continue taking jobs and benefits from our country."
1172,"I think Hillary is a snake, at least Trump is honest about himself. Hillary is a terrorist, look at Benghazi. Don't know why she's allowed to run this ar."
1173,"Trump's not a Purple Heart recipiant, he's just the world's largest idiot, and Hillary mishandled private information during her time as Secretary, she's a bimbo"
1174,"I do not really support Trump or Hillary and honestly, think both are bad for this nation. I am voting third party Jill Stein to make a statement. I think Trump is dangerous with his views on women, immigration, and the LGBT community while Hillary I do not trust due to her being investigated by the FBI. "
1175,Both are horrible. though Hilary hasn't done anything positive the whole she's been in office .  Trumps a business  man which is what we need. / 
1176,I do not favor any of the candidates in any of the parties.
1177,"Bernie Sanders is the most legitimate candidate and decent human that has run. Marco Rubio was okay too. But, Jill Stein and Gary Johnson are a little too extreme for my liking and I think that Trump and Clinton are honestly, so fucking awful."
1178,There doing what they've been  chosen to do. But it's always there choice to do what they should.
1179,I strongly oppose Trump and do not want to see him as President.  His talk and treatment of women and minorities is disgusting.  I support Hillary and will vote for her.
1180,"They are both bad decisions. Hillary is in my eyes more incompetent than Trump. As a senator she has done nothing. Then there is the email thing, and also the Benghazi thing... She's the type of person to smile to your face, then stab you in the back when you turn away. She is EVIL, and cannot be trusted."
1181,I think Hillary is going to do good things for women and fights for minorities and low-income people. Trump banks on the uneducated of American who have bigoted views. 
1182,I think they are both hiding alot and I don really want either one in presidency I would've rather had berne but the government in the whole needs to start working together instead of against each other
1183,Donald Trump is a dangerous menace. Clinton is a typical politician but not as harmful as Trump. 
1184,"Although it is no PC to do so, Donald Trump is honest, and he is stating facts.  Hillary on the other hand is quite possibly the most corrupt person that has ever run for office.   "
1185,The  choice is between to evils. So pick the lesser evil.
1186,"I find both candidates to be untrustworthy and neither is qualified for the office.  However, I see Trump as a slightly better option."
1187,"donald trump is a buffoon,a blowhard with no real understanding of the issues,temperamentally unsuited to be president. / hillary clinton is an experienced politician,knowledgeable compassionate,well suited to lead the country"
1188,this whole election is sad. the end. but unlike john adams and thomas jefferson as least neither one of them has claimed the other is dead yet. 
1189,"I am not sure why so many people dislike Hilary, but I can't stand Trump and what he stands for.  Therefore I do not want my children growing up thinking it is okay for a pig of a man like him to be president."
1190,"I think we are doomed either way. I really detest Trump, but I hate Clinton even more. I'd rather have an obnoxious asshole in the White House than someone who has told lie after lie. Plus, the leaked videos now of the shit the democratic party has done throughout this campaign....them talking about hiring mentally challenged people to stir up problems. It's all so disgusting. I hate Clinton's views on gun ownership."
1191,I believe that with Donald Trump you know where you stand and that he actually loves America and has our best interests at heart. I feel that Hillary Clinton is in it for her own agenda and is corrupt. 
1192,"My views on the candidates are that both are similarly corrupt and untrustworthy but that Clinton has knowledge of how government works and competent skills, as well as being more likely to be held in check by the government."
1193,"Hello! I am very disappointed in the crooked and illicit dealings that Hillary Clinton has been proved to have done.  I cannot trust someone who appears to be helpful but instead only helps herself to money and power.  I am also disappointed in the manner in which Donald Trump speaks and presents himself.  He is racist, sexist and pretty much a dishonorable person.  Neither should represent our country, USA,  that is valuable, honorable and worthy of respect."
1194,Hillary Clinton is better prepared to run our country. She is more professional and knowledgeable.
1195,"I think Trump is unqualified, abrasive, ignorant, and barbaric. Hillary is qualified, intelligent, experienced, and has an even temperament. I cannot understand people who vote for Trump."
1196,"I'm not super crazy about the Republican candidate, Donald Trump.  But, I have already voted for him to just to keep evil Hillary out!  I know she'll probably win as she expected to, but at least I feel as though I've don't what I can to do what's best (little to choose from) for our country.  "
1197,"Hillary Clinton is a capable leader with the interests of the people and the nation at heart. Donal Trump ran for president as a publicity stunt, and he clearly has no idea how a President of the United States should conduct himself/herself. Hillary Clinton will do her best for our nation. Donald Trump will leave matters significantly worse if elected."
1198,"I am definitely on Hilary's side, I agree with the fact that she will help people in middle and lower middle class. If Trump is put in that position I feel like he would corrupt things even more than they are now. And as the article stated, he has had many failed business ventures already."
1199,"clinton has love for the country, trump is just selfish,,,"
1200,Were doomed. They both SUCK.
1201,"Honestly both candidates are bad if not terrible.  / Donald trump is a misogynist, racist, divisive and very disconnected to an average American.  / Hillary Clinton is not very  trust worthy but at least she understands an average American / Of the two, Hillary Clinton is slightly better and fit to lead."
1202,Hillary is untrustworthy and Donald is more an outsider and not a typical politician 
1203,I believe Trump is well versed in telling a portion of Americans what thy want to hear. I think Hilary is a well polished politician that know the bullet points to hit while campaigning. Either way I wish we could start over and give other candidates a chance.
1204,"There are bad things for both of them. I think Trump is more likely to bring some change, which we need."
1205,I feel that none of the candidates are truly a good fit for our president. But I will choose to go for the lesser of the two evils.
1206,One is so evil that it's stupid and the other is so stupid that it's evil. You have a corrupt warmongering reptilian and a belligerent buffoon. 
1207,"HILLARY CLINTON SEEMS MORE EXPERIENCED, QUALIFIED AND POISED FOR THE JOB /  / DONALD TRUMP SOMETIMES ACROSS LIKE A RAVING LUNATIC WE SHOULD BE SCARED OF RATHER THAN BE AMUSED"
1208,"Clinton is not great, I would have preferred Sanders. But, we cannot let Trump win. He is erratic."
1209,"I agree with the author. I think Donald Trump is a megalomaniac who is only into the Presidency for himself and he will surround himself with similar people. He will be the demise of this country, I believe. Hillary on the other hand cares for the middle class and will stop some of the price gouging going on in the biopharmaceutical industry. She cares for the middle class, while Donald only cares to take care of his rich friends."
1210,"While I have concerns over some of Hillary's positions (her foreign policy is too bellicose for my taste, for example), Donald Trump frankly scares the hell out of me.  He lacks the experience or temperament necessary to lead our nation.  Secretary Clinton can be trusted to act in a dignified manner, respecting the Constitution and the American people.  Donald Trump, I fear, only respects his own self-interest. /  / I'm with her."
1211,"I feel Hillary Clinton would definitely be a better fit as president than Donald Trump. Hillary Clinton has a lot of experience in politics. Although she may not be very honest with the people, at least she is not someone who intentionally offend others whenever she is addressing the people in public. Also, Hillary Clinton cares more about the minority and immigrants in American in helping them build a better life. Whereas, Donald Trump is only threatening and saying offensive things about them, especially about women. / "
1212,"I don't have a lot of views on either candidate. If it was up to me we would have two different people to pick from, but it's not and we don't. But I must vote based on who I think will be able to run this country the way it needs to be, and the one with the most experience is Clinton. Donald Trump loves to spill hate, with this country needs right now is love and understanding. We need to pick based on who has the knowledge to run this country.  "
1213,They mean well. They really do.
1214,Trump may be honest but being honest doesn't make a good person.
1215,Donald Trump does not have enough experience to be the President he also says a lot of things that don't make sense. Hilary Clinton would be an amazing leader. 
1216,"While Hillary has her flaws like almost any politician or human, she is intelligent, experienced, and even-tempered. Donald Trump is out for himself. It scares me what our country would become under his rule. He is anti-women, anti-Latino, anti-Muslim. He is overly sensitive to perceived criticism and lacks good judgment or even the intelligence and understanding to run our country. I fear, he could be the next Hitler. This is a scary time for our country."
1217,Voting anti-Trump but don't like Hillary either. Less of two evils
1218,I am not for or against Trump and am slightly for Hillary.
1219,I believe Donald Trump will win this election because so many Americans are fed up with politicians in Washington not making real changes in government. Hilary Clinton is not trustworthy enough to lead this country.
1220,"I find both of the candidates unlikable for different reasons. Donald Trump is insensitive and a loaded canon, while Hillary Clinton feigns emotional warmth to cover up her deceptiveness."
1221,"hillary would be the worst decision for america. donald would be a little better, but we really needed bernie. "
1222,"I think that Trump is a madman. Jill Stein is also crazy, and Johnson sucks too. Hilar Clinton is he lesser of four evils. "
1223,I really feel like between trum and hillary neither is good option. Both will fail us somehow. Theres really no safe option.
1224,"I feel that there are not really any good options for the presidency, but I side mostly with Trump not because of his character but how our values line up. "
1225,I don't think either candidate is worthy of the presidency.  Bernie Sanders would've been the choice in my opinion.  
1226,"I think Hillary Clinton has the experience to run the country, and I feel Donald Trump is way in over his head. "
1227,Donald Trump has no place in politics but he belongs in jail. / Jill Stein is better than the other candidates.
1228,"considering hillary than trump, i think  hillary has the more experience and has more concern to the  us citizens, she may not be perfect  but her heart is for the people and not for personal interest. on the other hand trump has no experience when it comes to politics, "
1229,"I can not say that I am a huge fan of Hillary Clinton, that said - I think that she an astute and capable woman, and she will not lead our country down a blind path. Donald Trump, on the other hand, has little to no understanding of, or knowledge of international politics and he is a loose cannon. His answers regarding our nuclear weapons is pathological. I honestly believe the man is a complete Sociopath, and he is selling Americans afrightening and momumentally stupid future."
1230,"To me Hillary Clinton is my ideal candidate. I know that Hillary has this air of doubt around her, but I believe its just a bunch of nonsense. Trump on the other hand, is a pathological liar, and he is a misogynic bigot.   "
1231,"Hillary clinton is a lying, thief, murderer, corrupt and a poor excuse for a human being. Donald trump is patriotic and will make America great again."
1232,I feel that Hillary Clinton should not be permitted to run based upon her lying to Congress and that she should be indited and at the very least be banned from serving in a political position.  I would consider supporting a 3rd party candidate however in this election that seems like it would be throwing away my vote.
1233,"I think that Trump offers something new, a business aspect of government. We need a change and he could be it. I think Hillary is just the same government puppet that has been around for the last decade or so. She is NOT trustworthy and has some bad ideas."
1234,"Hillary, while flawed (if you believe the decades of continuous investigations), is much more qualified than the sexist, racist, narcissistic, fraudulent Donald Trump. I don't want to see America lose its democracy from a dictator who will destroy institutions, not let go of power and quite possibly destroy the planet, literally. "
1235,"The candidates are not the best choices. I may like one more than the other, but both are bad."
1236,Hillary is a very polished politician with many years of experience / Trump is a very polished business man that has many years of experience.  / I don't believe the government can be run like a business. Businesses are not run for the betterment of the employees but the betterment of the management and owners
1237,I personally feel like Trump is open but I feel with that openness it could also cause troubel to our contry. I am only pro Hilary because she has experience for the presidency. 
1238,"The idea of Donald Trump being president scares me. I know many people who have said they would move to another country if he is elected. I think he and his wife are hypocrites. Hillary has made some mistakes, but she owns up to them. She has a lot of experience, while Trump has little. "
1239,"Im not a big fan of either one.  I have always been a democrat, but I am not a big fan of Hilary.  She's just so shady and dishonest.  If Mitt Romney or John McCain was running against her, I would probably vote for them.  It's Trump though.  I actually had planned on voting for him, but changed my mind when I heard his quote about grabbing women's pussies.  He is a disgrace to men."
1240,Both flawed.  Hilliary (the Clintons) are very corrupt and in it for themselves.
1241,"hilary is the best choice for us americans , donald will run us to the ground"
1242,Personally I am torn..My beliefs run more in line with the republican way of thinking but Im not for the candidates. I feel Clinton has more presidental know how but she lies and cheats to get her own way and she is controlling..Trump is just a big mouth...although he s an intelligent man...It scares me to have either in office
1243,"Trump's lack of experience,involvement in large business, and poor composure are some my greatest concerns to his becoming POTUS.  I feel as though he would bomb someone based off being offended by a slight on Twitter. He is unstable and has convinced far too many Americans that he is not corrupt. Has anyone paid any attention to his business practices over the last 30 years? He's been sued numerous times for not paying his contractors and bypassing laws that he doesn't agree with. Sure, Hilary Clinton has some skeletons and is not perfectly clean. But at least she can say she's done more good for this country than bad."
1244,I view the candidates as both very capable but both different in many ways. Their political ideas are interesting and have their advantages and disadvantages and whoever gets elected should do what they feel is best to help America move forward because that is what all great politicians should do.
1245,"Hillary Clinton is astoundingly more well-qualified to be president than Donald Trump. Trump has shown that he cannot stay calm, he cannot stand any degree of criticism, he is divisive, he is bigoted and his polices are poorly thought out and will likely be ineffective or harmful for America. Clinton is not perfect, but she has a wealth of experience, clear and detailed policies and has shown an amazing ability to remain calm and collected under stress and provocation."
1246,Not much matters as the people that run this country aren't in the White House. Hillary would make our country look bad in the eyes of other countries with power. Trump is our best option.
1247,"I believe Donald Trump is a monster. I believe he incites hate and misplaced anger. / I believe Hillary Clinton truly cares for the American people. I think she might be involved in some sketchy activities in her personal life, but I'm not sure those activities will influence her ability to act as head of state. / I know nothing of the other two candidates. Honestly, I can't remember their names."
1248,I wished for an outsider like trump - but he's a bit too hot headed for me to trust in the Oval Office. Safer choice was Clinton. 
1249,"One has been in it forever and has no clue about the common man. One has not been in it at all, and has no clue about the common man."
1250," I believe the election was already rigged and Wikileaks has shown proof, so Hillary Clinton is not trustworthy.  She is also bigoted as she was a Goldwater girl and a Byrd mentee.I don't like Donald Trump at all.  He is also bigoted and untrustworthy.  That leaves us with third party candidates and unfortunately, America does not (yet) have a viable third party."
1251,"I think Trump has much better ideas to guide our country in the right direction, and I actually do think he will make America great again. While I think it will be more of the same with Hilary to further degrade the United States."
1252,"I do not support many of Trump's opinions and policies.  However, I am voting for him as a vote against Clinton, who I find to be a terrible choice.  I do not believe she is honest about what she stands for, she has committed illegal activities, and I disagree with most of her policy stances.  I think we have horrible candidates and I feel sick that I had to make this choice."
1253,"Donald Trump is a bloated, orange asshole. Hilary Clinton is the first woman who will become President. "
1254,"Hillary is the lesser evil, that's about it and at least she has an idea of what she is doing and is not straight out of a cartoon."
1255,Hillary figures she is entitled to the job because of past political participation. /  / Trump wants the job because of the issues he cares about and what he wants to accomplish. /  / Both candidates are flawed and damaged goods.  Neither candidate represents the ideal.
1256,"The more I hear and see of Hillary Clinton, the more disgusted I become.  The woman is clearly a career criminal with no regard at all for the country or the office of president.  She simply wants power, and money, and will do anything possible to have both.  While Donald Trump is not perfect, he is quite skilled in matters of business, has not be successfully proven guilty of any crimes, and has a much better track record.  Clinton has been proven to have committed treason, and it is beyond me as an American citizen why no one in authority has acted upon it to follow our laws.  This woman must be stopped at all costs."
1257,Hillary Clinton has experience and is a proven centrist who will work for the rights of all people. Donald Trump appeals to the know-nothing movement that has been growing in the USA over the last few decades.
1258,"I'm sick to my stomache about the elections. I wanted Bernie in there he would have been amaericas saving grace. But he didn't win, I dont' like Hillary I think she is untrustworthy...But I also think she will be better for the country than Trump. Trump only brings out hate towards women and minoritys."
1259,"I don't like either of them, but Hillary's ties to wall street really bother me and I hate her stance on gun rights.  Trump is an idiot but I think Hillary is just dangerous."
1260,"I feel that Donald trump cannot be elected. Period. I also don't feel that Hilary is a good  and I date either, but is the lesser of two evils. "
1261,"I am not a huge fan of Hillary or Trump. Both have a somewhat sketchy past of dishonesty and acts that could endanger the country. However, I do think Trump is one of the worst people to ever run for president. Nothing he has ever said or done proves that he is an eligible candidate, much less a good president. Hillary has a few intentions as president that I could support while Trump has zero.  "
1262,"Hillary will do a lot for social security but I don't entirely trust her.  /  / Trump does not care for immigrants, which I don't think is fair"
1263,"I feel that Trump does not have the temperament to become president, he is also racist and is causing anger and racism to be be more prevalent in the US. Clinton has some integrity issues but so does Trump and she is the better choice for president. "
1264,"Clition is not one for the people, she wants to do what she wants to do now for trump he is for the people and bringing back jobs into our country and making the country debt not so large it seems like"
1265,I think they both have their flaws but Donald Trump is awful.
1266,"I feel that Hillary wants to continue the advancement and progression of America. She is fighting for equal rights for all citizens and wants us to continue going forward. Whereas Trump wants to turn back time and push us back into the dark ages of America. A time when blacks were lynched and beaten in the streets, where White men had their boot on the back of the neck of the working man refusing to let them up to be equals with others. Trump wants to destroy all the progression we have achieved and would be not only disastrous for America but a great threat to who we are and how we are known around the world."
1267,"Donald Trump is the worst thing to ever happen to politics and I truly believe that. He's made our government look like an actual joke, has changed our rhetoric to violence and judgement. Worst of all he's drawn attention away from the two best bets for improving our country, Sanders and Clinton."
1268,I feel Donald trump represents everything bad that is in America  / Hillary will be a great help of continuing to move America forward 
1269,"This political debate has been embarrassing to our country. Both candidates have acted very savagely and disrespectful to each other and in representation of our country.  However, I have chosen to vote for Trump as a vote for life."
1270,Hillary Clinton  seems to be not trustworthy but she is a woman and has a lot of power to help women succeed in the future.  She is fierce and intelligent.  I hope she can be more transparent if she becomes President of the US.  Donald Trump is a business man who is seems to want to help the wealthy class and will leave us middle class and low income citizens to fend for ourselves.  
1271,They both have their own agendas and neither will bring anything good to the table. 
1272,I am a teacher. I don't feel like Trump supports the people in my workforce. That is why I will vote for Hillary. 
1273,"I don't like either, but as a former Army officer I know if anyone in the Army did anything like what Hillary did they would be in serious legal trouble....  I find it disturbing that people find her qualified for office if she can't be bothered to understand basic email and record keeping policies.   /  / Trump has many personal flaws, but he is an outsider and personally I think a fresh set of eyes is what Washington needs if we will ever restore our confidence in our government."
1274,NA
1275,The only option is not trump.  he is not a politician and really doesnt know what he is doing its clear everytime he speaks.
1276,I dont like them
1277,Hilary is horrible and people should be very afraid of our future 
1278,"I think Donald Trump is dangerous, unintelligent and overall a disgusting person. I believe Hillary Clinton is a very intelligent, highly skilled and emotionally intelligent person. Hillary is our only choice for President"
1279,"I am not a huge fan of Hilary, but she better represents me than Trump. Both candidates have lied and been party to special interest groups, but at least Hilary has attempted to be transparent whereas there are many things Trump has chose not to disclose."
1280,Trump's actions and words are disgusting. I doubt he can read and he is hardly prepared to be president. He is unstable and can't be trusted in a crisis.  Hillary is calculating. She should have dumped Bill when he cheated on her the first time! She was dumb to have a private email server while Sec. of State. I do trust her to protect women's' rights and I think she is the better of the two candidates. 
1281,"Don't get me wrong-I'm no Trump fan. It's the lesser of two evils, and Hillary leads the pack in the evil department. She has been in politics basically her whole life and all she has done is make money off the backs of those she claims to support. /   She is a liar and a crook.Period. /   So, that leaves only the Trumpster to vote for, a narcissist to the degree of the one we have in office now. /  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think we are in for a hell of a ride either way. God help us all."
1282,Hillary is a 2nd choice candidate. She has a lot of negatives and is not transparent enough. Trump is a demagogue. Who is more of a salesman than a candidate. He has built his entire image in the presidential race on the Birther movement. I think he's been conducting internal polls for years to see how well that message and his image has been resonating. Having supporters who believe that the first black president is a Manchurian who is muslim and not born in this country speaks to the level of bigotry these people hold as core values. Thats what allowed him to run with such dangerous and offensive rhetoric and succeed. He is an incredibly dangerous man who believes very little of what he says publically yet also believes all of his own hype.
1283,"Hillary Clinton is a career politician who offers up more of the ""pragmatic"" approach to progressive goals that always put the most vulnerable in the back seat and rarely push for actual change. Trump represents a reality TV actor who strikes a chord with voters because the media around them has changed. In the end neither will bring radical change to the country, but will slow down progress in places where is badly needed and disparity of laws and levels of education, health, etc will vary gratefly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. "
1284,I vote Trump because i already know what Hillary will do and i dont like it. Trump can bring change
1285,"I feel closer to the conservative side of Donald Trump as far as gun control, war, and immigration. I fall along with Hillary Clinton when it comes to women's rights and healthcare. "
1286,"I am not sure if I would vote for Hilary if she were literally running against any other candidate.  She is the slightly less evil choice.  I felt that her husband was a good president, so perhaps that would also help her be a decent president.  But I wouldn't trust a word that came out of her mouth.  I feel like she lies as much as she tells the truth, if not more.  This is a sad, sad time for our country."
1287,"Hillary Clinton is morally wrong. Despite the knowledge and power to help average americans, she chooses to help her rich friends. Trump is just stupid, and this is widely more successful then even he planned for. We can't judge him for this isn't even his realm, he's merely taking advantage of the situation."
1288,I believe Hillary is very untrustworthy. She will not progress this country at all and the corruption will greaten. I feel Trump will cut through the bull crap of politics and really open up the views of politicians. I also believe our debt will not increase with him. 
1289,"I don't like either one, but Trump is totally ill-equipped and dangerous."
1290,"Trump can not become president otherwise we will go into a recession worse than when Bush was in office, Anytime a republican gets in they ruin the country to make the rich money"
1291,I just feel that both candidates are interested in power.  Both candidates seem very untrustworthy and will go to great extremes to gain personal power.  I just feel that both cannot be trusted.  What is upsetting is that this is the best candidates that the political parties are able to offer?  Really kind of embarrassing as an American.
1292,I like Donald Trump! Obamacare needs to go away! Hilary Clinton is a liar.
1293,Donlad trump is a great entertainer and buisness man i dont see him being the president and Hilary seems humble enough and dedicated enough for the job and i guess it would make history to have the 1st women president i would love to see it
1294,"Hillary Clinton is not the candidate that I will vote for. I don't trust her political ideology because the news makes her out to be untrustworthy. I am going to vote for Donald Trump, he seems like he will make America great again. He seems like the right political candidate."
1295,"I believe that Donald Trump will get down to business in government and stop the corruption between them and society. Hillary Clinton would further increase corruption and the debt ceiling America is in. As for Gary Johnson and Jill Stein, I do not have any insight on them as they will definitely not win then presidency since Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton have reigned popularity in America."
1296,Hillary is an old vet. Trump is the new boy with a big mouth and all talk.
1297,The world is mostly low income. Help the majority of the people the world might get a little better. I guess if its true then go for hillary clinton. We sure dont need a hot head like donald trump as president thats too much power for him
1298,Donald repre every thing bad in America / Hillary will be the one to get America back on track 
1299,"I just read on FB, something that makes sense. / These two candidates are like divorced parents fighting over custody of children, and all they want to do is go to Grandma's. /  / I am very afraid for my country if Donald Trump wins.  He is one of the most incompetent people that I have ever seen.  He has no knowledge of the way a country should be run, and will try to rule everyone.  He has a whiny attitude, that is not acceptable for a President.  He will cut taxes for the wealthy and the poor will have to pay for it. /  / Hilliary Clinton, is very knowledgeable about country procedure.  I am sure that she helped her husband, when he was President.  I realize that she has made a lot of mistakes over the years, but she does have intelligence and common sense.  She doesn't seem to be a hot head, and will tackle problems by thinking them through first.  Not sure what all she can or can't do, but I believe she will try her hardest."
1300,Hillary has been given a chance in government and failed.  Trump needs to be given a chance to see if he can use his business knowledge to help USA.
1301,"I feel that Donald Trump is very inexperienced and too hot headed to lead our country, in addition to being sexist and racist. Hillary is not a great choice either, but she is definitely qualified for the job."
1302,"Trump scares me and I feel if he is the next President, he will destroy this country. /  / Clinton has experience. I agree with most of her views and feel she would make a good President. "
1303,I believe Donald Trump is insane. / I believe Hillary Clinton is a fraud.  / I don't like the two party system. / Go Bernie.  / Go Johnson.
1304,"I will not vote for Hillary, she is under investigation. She has gotten Americans killed. Trump is not that greatest candidate either but I prefer him to her."
1305,"While I may not completely support Hillary Clinton, I definitely do not support Donald Trump. Someone with such racist misogynistic views who also favors big business and who could possibly be in charge of choosing multiple supreme court justices is not only scary, it's terrifying."
1306,I think Trump is in it for big business and the wealthy people.  I think he is against women.  Clinton is for middle class and hopefully will help American with the healthcare issues.  
1307,"Although I don't like Donald Trump I do agree with many of his positions that impact our economy and the border. I do not agree with his position on women's right to choose. I appreciate that he is his own person, unbeholden to finance from special interests and speaks his mind. I dislike that he disparages others, does not give substantive methodology for his ideas that we can anticipate would be successful.  However, I also know that he would not be governing alone and that I have some faith that the normal legislative processes and expert advisers would help keep him on a viable path.   /  / I very much appreciate HIllary's devotion to this country, I believe she wants the best but she changes her tune to often to the audience she is in front of at the moment.  I appreciate that she may be the first woman president of this nation and it is of benefit to have Bill at her side who has lived it before in white house.  I do not however, agree with most of her positions and the basic democratic philosophy of tax and spend and government taking care of people who should be putting efforts forward for their own future. Government size and bueracracy should be seriously retooled to be more efficient and less of it, not increased. "
1308,"For me Mr. Donald Trump is very arrogant, lies a lot and doesn't have the temperament needed to be President. On the other hand, although Mrs. Hillary Clinton is very well educated and have a lot of experience in politics, there are some confusing facts about her political performance in the past that hurt her image."
1309,donald trump is evil. i am not completely a fan of hillary clinton but i feel safer with her as president than i would with trump
1310,i really don't have any views. I think we are in trouble with both candidates. 
1311,"One would potentially be disastrous, the other is most likely going to continue things as they already are. Slightly bad is better than atrocious."
1312,I think that the Democratic party failed us by nominating Clinton. Sanders should have been our candidate. I'm worried for the direction our country is potentially going with either major candidate.
1313,great deal this election for our country USA
1314,"I really don't care for either candidate to be honest, I think both of them were only in it for themselves. Hillary themes like she would say and do anything to get elected, while Trump seems like he's off the crazy train. I think we're all pretty much screwed regardless of who gets elected."
1315,Neither of them are great candidates but Hillary is the lesser of two evils.
1316,"Neither candidates are an ideal choice. Donald Trump is a wild card and can sometimes be a loose canon. He doesn't have any political experience, which these days is seeming more and more like a good thing. He can be bombastic and offensive, but at least he's a straight shooter. He doesn't mess around with all the politically correct bull crap, which is also a nice change. Hilary Clinton is a corrupt liar who would say anything to remain in power. She flip-flops all the time on issues based on whoever she's talking to and based on whatever is the most popular opinion even if it goes directly against her past stances. She might be one of the most corrupt politicians in America history and sold out the state department to enrich herself. Unfortunately, nobody seems to really notice since mainstream journalism in the United States is dead. The mainstream media is in the Democratic party's back pocket, so the information people are receiving is incredibly skewed and borderline inaccurate."
1317,Hilary is a lying scumbag who should be in jail. While Trump is not perfect he is a far preferable choice.
1318,both parties' nominees seem very distrustful and power hungry
1319,"Donald Trump would make the best choice because he is a business man, and wants more for this country than what it has become. /  / Clinton is a terrible person and has abused her power for years. She is not fit to run my country."
1320,"I do not trust or respect Donald Trump. I do not want him to represent the United States. I don't fully trust Hillary Clinton either, she is still a politician who has protected her reputation possibly by breaking the law. However, I would still vote for Hillary who has appeared to help the middle class and supported women's rights in the past. "
1321,Picking one or the other at this point is just picking the lesser of two evils.
1322,I think that politics in america has become a dog and pony show. I don't think it matters. I think the very wealthy few are controlling everything. Nothing will change unless people realize this and take action.
1323,"I think Donald Trump is the more honest candidate, but I disagree one hundred percent with his views. I also think his antics and readiness to insult and fight would lead to a great deal of strife with other leaders. Hillary is dishonest, cold and unlikeable but she is smart and worthy of being a leader. I think she will help people like me more than Donald Trump would. She is the lesser of two evils, and the best choice."
1324,I feel as that both the candidates that are currently running will both ruin America as what it stands now. Both of them are evil. I feel as if we will fail as a country if one of them are elected.
1325,"Donald Trump is fairly crude politically, but that does not make him incompetent. I think that he will consult with specialists when making tough decisions and will make a good, if not great, president. Hillary Clinton is sneaky and dishonest. She cares for nobody but herself. She will say whatever she needs to get in office.  Her policies will continue the already steep decline of this country and destroy it."
1326,"Ideally, this entire thing needs to br redone.  That wont happen, so given the choices, hillary is better.  Trump is a buffoon. "
1327,"Hillary yes, Donald no."
1328,"Donald Trump seems to be very angry about the way America is going right now, which is incredibly similar to myself. Hillary Clinton supports late term abortion, should be in jail (any other person would be), is a liar, got a rapist off and laughed about it. I just can't, in good mind, vote for her. "
1329,"I like Donald when he first started but, he seems to be a loose cannon and I don't trust his actions against women. / Hillary I don't know if we can trust her either but, I believe she is less evil than Trump"
1330,Trump is at least speaking his mind. Hilary seems to be dishonest and can only attack Trump with things that to me have no bearing on his ability to be president.
1331,It is very unfortunate that this country is forced to vote for these two. 
1332,"While I do have some reservations about Hillary Clinton, I cannot understand how millions of people in our country desire to elect a man like Donald Trump. Clinton is not perfect, and no candidate will ever be. However, I have no doubt that a combination of her personal qualities and professional experience makes her one of the most qualified people to have ever run for president of the United States. Trump on the other hand looks out only for himself and steps on everyone to get what he desires. There is no person more unfitting to lead this country than Donald Trump."
1333,I am a Trump supporter.  Clinton had people murdered in Benghazi and is very untrustworthy with the thousands of classified emails she had out in the open.  Clinton has been in Washington for many years and has done nothing to help average people.  Obama is also a horrible president and with Clinton you will just get an extension of him.
1334,"I certainly do not agree with just about anything Trump says or stands for. I also, for the most part, do not believe he truly represents the bulk of the Republican Party. Clinton, while with her own faults and issues, seems more likely a viable candidate for the office. Granted, if given the option, I would not pick either of these candidates, rather I'd rather vote third party, most likely for Jill Stein. If she is not on the ballot in my state, I will most likely vote Clinton."
1335,"i think donald trump is honest, and concerned about the well being of the general american population. i think hillary clinton is in it for the money, and the power. donald already has money and power. "
1336,I think Hilary Clinton would make a good President>Her husband would would be a help to her.She has the experience to run the country.Trump has never held public office and lacks the experience to lead.He also seems racist and sexist.
1337,"I think Donald Trump is an absolute joke and anyone who votes for or supports him is delusional. Though Clinton isnt perfect, she does have political experience and experience in the White House. She's an actual politician and not an entertainer. The vote should be a no brainer  "
1338,"Clinton is a self-absorbed, extremely corrupt liar who will do nothing but continue pushing Obama's anti-American agenda. / Trump is a jerk but at least he's not a corrupt politician and I believe he will at least try to do the things he promises which I mostly agree with. I'm willing to take a chance with him rather than vote for the Democratic witch."
1339,Neither are ideal yet it is important to get America going back in the direction of real Americans again.
1340,Hillary is the only option. Trump would ruin the country even more and create a divide between the American people / 
1341,Don't trust or like Hilary due to Bengahzi and email scandal - don't particularly like Trump but identify more Republican and would prefer him to other candidates
1342,"Trump is a bully with some many negatives that they are too numerous to list. Hillary is not a liberal like me and therefore does not share many of my opinions, BUT she is not Trump and that is what matters now."
1343,I think trump is out for himself. He is a bully who doesn't understand politics. He will embarrass us. Hillary isn't perfect but she does respect the office. She also has actual experience in politics. 
1344,"This election is a joke, and so are the current candidates."
1345,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is a liar who manipulates people however she can to better herself. She has no regard or concern for the military or the average American's life. I believe that Donald Trump is fighting for the presidency to truly make America great again and that his concern for the average American and our military, as well as his financial background will only assist him in our goals to restore our democracy."
1346,I think Hillary will help the middle class which is what I am.  I don't think the rich should have tax cuts.  I think Trump may be too volatile.
1347,I think Hillery is a liar and a fraud. Trump isn't perfect but he is a businessman. and even if he did lose a fortune he also made one 
1348,"I don't support Clinton or Trump.  If Clinton is elected I question how long she will be in office due to the FBI investigations.  I also don't agree with her on any of her ideas or her liberal platform.  Donald Trump is an embarrassment to the US.  I would ordinarily vote for the Republican nominee but this time I can't.  He is a racist bigot that should never be a role model for our youth.  We would take huge steps backwards with a Trump presidency.  I am voting for Gary Johnson who is the only sane, honest candidate running.  While I don't agree with all of Gary's platform, I do agree with most and I do believe he would be good for America. "
1349,"I'm a moderate independent.  I feel that Hillary Clinton can't be trusted, lies when facts and evidence are presented to her, and is just too secretive.  Donald Trump, on the other, for better or worse, blurts out whatever is on his mind, so he is much more open about his opinions on issues.  I don't think Trump is very well mannered but, I believe he will do a better job as president than Hillary Clinton."
1350,"I'm very scared to vote for either candidate to be honest with you. Trump seems very unrealistic at times and also can be a loose cannon, but some of his views I do support. On the other hand I don't think I could trust Hillary at all because of her email scandal and the whole bhen ghazi situation."
1351,i dont really care for either candidate
1352,"Hillary Clinton is a clear win, she has exhibited this through her demonstrations of political competency for over the past several decades. From a social climate standpoint, having a woman as PoTUS is timely. There is nothing good to say about Donald Trump; the thought of him running the country is nothing short of terrifying."
1353,"The candidates are some of the worst choices we've had in recent years. I haven't been on this planet long but I got to see, possibly, one of the best candidates and that was Bernie Sanders. He lost in a very rigged and corrupt fashions so now we're left with either an imbecile or a vile woman. The choices are bad and the lesser of two evils is, surprisingly to some people, still evil. I'm voting 3rd option, which is what most should do if they really want change."
1354,I feel the media is skewing the facts.  I will vote based on the platforms.  I think the media is basing this election on the personality of the candidates rather than what they stand for.  
1355,"I dont trust either of the  major two. Gary Johnsom just seems like he isn't even able to awnser some basic questions. I know Hillary is untrustworthy and corrupt. If Donald is untrustworthy and corrupt at least it hasn't been while holding office, he was doing what he had to do to make things work. Hillary was doing what she had to do to keep herself in power and influence and money. I am voting against Hillary more so than for Turmp."
1356,"I believe that Hilary Clinton is a liar and a cheat, willing to do whatever she pleases as long as it suits her needs. She doesn't care about the american people only those who can line her pockets. She will win the election because she is cheating, I never see Hilary lawn signs or bumper stickers around, I always see trump. Donald Trump is honest and tells it how it is. I believe that if he were elected he would make america great again and I feel deeply sadden because due to the lying and cheating of the democrats we may never find how how good america could have been."
1357,I don't understand how anyone can support Donald Trump.  He's pretty much criticized every minority.  How in the world can we tell our children to not be racist not to bully if we elect a man who has spewed racist comment after racist comment and is one of the biggest bullies in America.  Yes children don't bully don't pay any attention that we voted one in to be the most powerful man in the world.  Yeah that will send a great message.  Hillary isn't the greatest candidate and has made mistakes but I know she will put children and families first which is by far the most important issue for me.
1358,i think Clinton has the experience and can be trusted to run the country. I think trump doesn't have the experience and he scares me if he were ever to be in office.
1359,"I like Donald Trump is what American needs, a new type of politician.  Hilary Clinton is going to be the same old same old.  Therefore, I am voting for Trump. "
1360,"honestly, i dont favor either candidate, i was a Bernie supporter from the start. But i do believe that Clinton is the lesser of two evils in this election, so i WILL be voting for her. I think Trump is a terrorist and it blows my mind that people would openly support that monster."
1361,"Honestly, neither of them are fully qualified to run our country, so this becomes who is the lesser of two evils. It also should be about who actually has political experience."
1362,I strongly support Hillary Clintion. I think that she is the Best Candidate in this election.
1363,"Gun control is the most important issue to me, and therefore I support Hillary Clinton and her efforts to impose greater restrictions on gun purchases and usage. I cannot in good conscience vote for Donald Trump, given his views on women, minorities, and the NRA."
1364,"My views are remarkably similar to the blogger's. I don't whole-heartedly support Hillary Clinton because I don't completely trust her and because she has some skeletons in her closet, as most politicians do. However, I think she is a far better choice for President than Donald Trump could ever be. His attitude and demeanor do not make a person who would be a good fit for the White House. He is loud, foul-mouthed, disrespectful and insulting of too many demographic groups, is narcissistic and temperamental, and displays a tendency towards physical aggressiveness when things don't go his way. With someone like that in the Oval Office, it is easy to imagine international incidents arising, even with our current allies. Hillary is more level-headed and focused and would make the better leader of our country."
1365,Hillary-too many lies. Continuance of Obamacare will be a disaster.  / Trump-lesser of two evils 
1366,"Clinton has lied time and time again in the face of Americans regarding how she handled Benghazi, dishonoring American lives and American values.She dribbles on and on about how she will stand up for women and children, yet her pockets are lined with blood money from countries that treat women and children worse than most treat a stray dog.  She has flipped flopped on marriage rights.  And she has even said that she has a private and public stance on issues.  You can't have the best of both worlds, Hillary.  If you feel one way privately, and do something different publicly, you're not only lying to the America people, you're lying to yourself.   Hillary wants to daunt Trump with his morals and behaviors, yet her own household has been very questionable, especially her husband's actions.  She is as guilty as Bill when it comes to his affairs because she taunted those women that he abused. /  / Trump isn't the perfect candidate, but he's the best one we have to vote for this election.  Hillary goes on and on about how he borrowed money from his father.  So what?  That makes him smart.  He borrowed the money to start a business rather than going into debt to do it.  When her own kid came out of college, Chelsea had a six figured job waiting for her....who does Hillary think she's kidding?   /  / Trump may have gone into bankruptcy in the past, but he's soared out of it.  Because he knows how to process deals and what it takes to make a system work.  Those are skills that can be used in the presidency to strengthen American businesses and provide for the American people.  I like that he doesn't sit back and kiss people's asses either.  Our foes and the terrorist that seek to harm this nation need to be taught a lesson and get the hell out of our country.  "
1367,hillary ok not much choice.  trump is a complete ass. 
1368,I am in favor of Trump. 
1369,I believe that this election is pretty much picking the best of 2 evils.. I see trump doing more for our country than Hillary and the face that she shared government information and is not being punisher for it shows just how corrupt she is.
1370,Hillary Clinton is by no means perfect but she'll be a better president than Trump. He's a egocentric bully who has no business being close to power.
1371,I think Hilary Clinton has more political experience. I think Donald Trump is a jerk and I wouldn't vote for him for dogcatcher.
1372,I believe that Hilary Clinton is the obvious better choice. Never has there been a President with as little political experience as there is with Donald Trump. Clinton has a lifetime of experience in politics and more recently as our Secretary of State. She has proven herself to be competent for the greatest position in the United States. Donald Trump is ultimately unqualified. He is impulsive and does not have the temperament to be President. He also incites hate and singles out populations in this country. Electing Donald Trump would take us back in time many years. We are trying to move forward.
1373,I feel that Clinton has definitely made mistakes but has our best interest at heart. I feel that. Trump is an ignorant child who has way too much ego and attitude to ever successfully run a country
1374,I would not vote for either if I knew that the electoral college would vote for anyone else rather than a leading party nominee. I feel neither are trustworthy and both will lie while in office to further their own gains. They will both help bills be passed that help large corporations while hurting the working class American. I am only voting for Hillary because (of the two candidates for major parties) she will at least treat the underprivileged and undervalued people in our society with more care.
1375,I am really disgusted with how Trump communicates. He comes off as uneducated and as New York Trash. He is a rat. I am also weary of Hilary but feel she is the lesser of two evils and at least knows how to communicate during the debates and answer questions. Trump will be a very poor communicator among foreign nations. I am afraid we will get nuked with him as president.
1376,Trump has a lot of unrealistic ideas. Hilary has a lot of scandals but is more qualified than trump.
1377,"I feel both candidates are not the best choices.  However, media was very biased against Trump when in reality Clinton is much worse.  She knows too much and id more deceptive than anyone in office.  Even if she does win, which I strongly hope doesn't happen, she will not make the full term and will be impeached."
1378,"I think Donald Trump is a lying hot head who will say anything to get in office. I believe he only wants the presidency because he wants to feel all powerful. I think Hilary is the lesser of two evils in this situation. I think she is capable of doing the job. She may not be the most trustworthy, but I think she is even tempered and will do a decent job and not get us into trouble with other countries. "
1379,NA
1380,"I believe Trump is a fraud, a sexual predator, and a bigot. I believe Hillary is not strong on matters of privacy and her winning would be based entirely on her sex or her husband. Neither is particularly likely to favor the LGBTQ+ community, which is often a matter of survival for people like me more than just an opinion-based issue like most other things."
1381,"I think that Clinton, while bad on her own is the lesser of two evils. I feel as though Trump's lack of experiance is politics is not a boon, but a weakness becaue it will prevent him from fully reaching deals that will bring America forward. I do not like Clintons email debackle, but she has experience. I am more comfertable with mroe of the same than with a radical new approach to a president. "
1382,"I think Trump is flawed. However, something needs to be done about the border. I also agree with him on his non-interventionist foreign policy. /  / Clinton is a total fraud. Everything she says is carefully considered and poll-tested. She has no true feelings and will say anything to get elected. She is crooked as demonstrated by the Clinton Foundation and her email situation."
1383,"Trump is a far better candidate, and will fight to make our country better, and keep terrorists out. Clinton will just a bigger mess of tings, and crime will increase and  you will see more crime, homeless people,  poverty, and Terrorists attacks"
1384,I always vote Democrat because social freedoms are the most important issue for me. I think Trump would be horrible for the country because he lacks diplomacy and the ability to defuse high-stress situations. He would enthusiastically endorse war at any opportunity. I don't care about Clinton at all; she wins my vote because she's not Trump.
1385,"I feel that I will vote for the evil I know. That is Hillary. Unfortunately if I vote for Jill stein which whom most of my values appear to align, it will only take away a vote from Hillary and that would be giving Trump more wiggle room to win. I feel he is a misogynistic, bigoted jack ass whose rhetoric has already damaged race relations in the USA. He might as well be wearing a KKK cloak. If he truly was for more jobs in america he would make sure his products were made here not oversees. He was not a positive influence on Atlantic City he was one of the people who damaged that city and the employees of his casino. He is a liar."
1386,"I dislike Clinton. She's dishonest and sleazy. She's a liar too. I hate her quite frankly. I'm neutral to Trump, he says some ridiculous stuff but at least you know what you're getting with him."
1387,"I honestly believe that the bipartisan system is antiquated and neither one of the two candidates representing the Democratic and Republican parties is suitable for the presidency. If it were up to me, I'd leave President Obama in office for a third term. Sure, he was not perfect; however, we would be a much better choice. /  / Hilary is dishonest and I'm not sure I could trust her with the welfare of Americans. / Trump is a bigot and has no political experience. And I would be frightened for our foreign affairs with him in office."
1388,Dislike both trump and clinton. I think either one will be bad for our country
1389,"I am in favor for Donald Trump, because Hilary Clinton not only took American lives, she released classified information to foreign superpowers without authorization. That is treason."
1390,"I don't like either candidate, but since I feel I have to vote, I will vote for the person who I think will do less harm to this country.  Donald Trump is not my ideal candidate but he is better than Hillary.  With all of the leaked emails coming out and the atrocity that is the Clinton Foundation, how can anyone trust that woman.  People like Hillary have had their whole lives to make a change in this country and they never have because all they care about is the elites.  "
1391,"I don't favor either one.  They are both extreme authoriatrians and dishonest.  Trump made money off fake charities and Hillary made about 200,000 from wallstreet per speech given. Neither one will bring this country in a better direction."
1392,Donald Trump does not have enough common senses to be president and Hilary is not very likable. I'm more in favor of Hilary but don't think she will accomplish anything while president. We pretty much are screwed as a country with either one of them 
1393,"I feel that Donald Trump often says the wrong thing and I fear that he will start a war with other countries because of his lack of keeping his mouth shut and out right boldness and arrogance. I feel like while he might make some good changes, he is not really the role model I would want my son looking up to.  /  / I feel Hillary Clinton has made mistakes and while she has done some great things for woman, for children and for the middle class citizens of America, I feel if I had to choose between her and Donald trump I would choose her simply because she is the lesser of two evils. Some of her stances on controversial topics are ones I do not agree with and therefore I would only vote for her if I had to.  /  / This election, even though I know I am choosing between the two.. I will not cast a vote for either. I will write in a candidate simply because I feel neither Trump or Clinton are worth my vote. I will write in Bernie Sanders even though I know he won't become next president!"
1394,"I believe that neither candidate is an ideal fit for President and am still thoroughly surprised that of all the candidates that ran initially, it has come down to the two that people seem to like the LEAST. Donald Trump is absolutely the worse of the two candidates. He is dangerous and having him as our leader makes America look like a caricature of itself. Clinton is just more of the same shady, corrupt government we've been dealing with for the last decade or so. She is definitely a weak candidate, but I would rather have more of the same than risk a Trump presidency."
1395,Hillary Clinton is well-qualified to be president. She has been shown to be more honest than other politicians. Trump has no qualifications to be president and is a terrible example of a leader.
1396,i dont think hilary is honest. at least everyone outright knows what donald trump is about.
1397,"If Trump wins, I give America no more than 5 years before it is a complete disaster/it is destroyed. If we don't do it from within, another country will surely do it from the outside. If Clinton wins, we can continue to grow as a country and other countries will consider us a target to be destroyed"
1398,"Hillary favors globalization, while Trump favors the exact opposite of globalization. Trump wants to segregate while Clinton wants to integrate. Trump wants to take by allowing large corporations tax to sidestep financial laws if centered in America, but could allow in result allow usd to be transported more so elsewhere, but Clinton wants to give in order to promote prosperity with all. "
1399,"I don't like Trump it's not that I suddenly didn't like him I didn't like him the first time around either. Yes, he's a self made business man but he's a self made business man and you don't go from bottom to top without crossing a few lines. I don't particularly like Clinton either.... out of the two she's a better candidate. She's more likely to listen to what someone has to say."
1400,I think they're both poor choices but as far as my own personal beliefs and views i align more with the message of Donal Trump. There is nothing wrong in my view of making America the strongest it can be and THEN going out and helping foreign governments. I also am strongly against the actions of Clinton (primarily the classified information.) Being in the military i know any mishandling of such information would be grounds of serious punishment and i feel there is a large double standard at play when it comes to her case. Also i feel that if she sincerely did all those things out of ignorance then she is most definitely not qualified to be trusted with even more sensitive materials as president.  
1401,"Hillary's hawkishness worries me. I voted for Bernie in the primaries and am considering Stein in the election. I felt that the DNC rigged the primary in favor of Hillary and squashed the Bernie movement. Clinton's vp pick, Kaine was very disappointing to me, as he is such a moderate. I wanted to her to pick someone more progressive to at least acknowledge that many democrats want a more progressive candidate. I think Donald Trump actually does make a few good points---I think NAFTA was harmful to those living in poverty. But I think he flip flops based on how he feels he can move voters, and I have no idea how he would behave in office. His sexism, xenophobia, racism and machoism worries me.  Same with his anti-intellectualism."
1402,"I think Trump is a liar, a pervert, and ignorant. I don't believe he is qualified to be president. I don't have much to say about Hilary other than she is a much better choice."
1403,I don't have any views on them. I feel they all suck
1404,I am not happy with our choice of candidates in this election.  There has been way too much media coverage that focuses on Trump and Clinton personally rather than trying to find their viewpoints on different issues facing this country.  I believe that Donald Trump is a terrible joke and our government is turning into a reality show and I worry about the rest of the world taking us seriously.  I am concerned about this email scandal but I still believe that Clinton is the lesser of two evils.
1405,I love Hillary clinton
1406,Clinton is fine on social issues but bad on economic ones; she's too close to the banks. Trump is just abhorrent. 
1407,I do not like either candidate
1408,"I think both are out for themselves.  Both make promises because they sound nice.  However, Hillary is more competent than Donald.  He has no idea what it takes to be president."
1409,"I am terrified by Trump. He is a dictator in the making, and I am especially scared of what a Trump presidency would mean internationally (although domestically he is also a nightmare). I am not a hardcore Clinton supporter, largely because I am not interested in presidential dynasties within families (be it father and son, or brothers, or husband and wife...or mother and daughter, for that matter). She has said and done some things that don't thrill me -- largely because I am way more liberal than she appears to be (at least politically). It did bug me that the blog post called Trump ""Trump"" and Clinton ""Hillary"" (yes, her campaign promotes the use of her first name, but in journalism, I prefer she get the same respect/treatment as the male candidate). Finally, as this campaign has progressed, my respect for Clinton has grown -- I was not really excited about her early on, but increasingly think she it highly qualified and could be a strong president (if Congress will let her do anything). "
1410,"Trump is a nightmare, an idiot, unsophisticated, rude, sexist, racist. HRC is not prefect, but has ex[experience and a great professionalism. Dems are always better for the economy, Thank you Obama for bring the economy back from the disaster that was George Bush. He left the White House with the US economy the worst since the great depression. Trump would ruin USA if elected. HRC WILL WIN!!!!!"
1411,I think that Hilary knows more about the presidency and its responsibilities.  I think she thinks before she acts.  Trump is very quick tempered and often acts without thinking first.
1412,I believe that when elected either of the candidates will lead to the ultimate demise of the country.
1413,"I view Clinton has someone who acts in her own interests, and is deceitful, but is familiar enough with politics that she won't do anything to outlandish. On the couple issues important to me, her history shows her being pretty flip-floppy, and hard to trust. / With Trump I feel he is to inexperienced to run the country, and his views tend to be a little to extreme. As well I also disagree with him on the couple issues that are most important to me. "
1414,"While they both have their good and bad spots, Clinton certainly is the more experienced one and would likely do well as President. I do not agree with her views on many many issues but she understands the Office of the President and would handle the role well. Trump is, as I have said since day 1, a real life Pied Piper. He was convinced the throngs to follow him into a world he knows nothing about it and doesn't publicly show he cares to learn anything about. "
1415,I think both parties are liars and are in it for monetary gain.  With that said I deplore Trump and am ashamed of the people I know who would fall for his tactics of digging to the darkest corners of the American core and people fall for it.
1416,"I believe Hillary Clinton has been shown to be a liar and is part of the political machine in Washington D.C. She will appoint another liberal judge to the Supreme Court so that she keep the marriage amendment and the abortion amendment alive and well. Her foundation is corrupt and she makes millions off it and with her speeches to corporations and she has ties to foreign government officials. She lied about Benghazi and she lied about her emails and the list goes on. She will only continue the flawed and corrupt legacy of Barack Obama for four to eight more years.  /  / Trump is loud and politically incorrect but truthful. He tells the truth and loves our country. I believe he will do everything in his power to straighten out our military and our government, our economy and our borders. The media has been biased about him and he believes, as I do and has shown to be true, that the system is rigged. "
1417,"I don't really like either of them, but I feel that Hilary is the best choice of two evils because she's been in politics before and knows how to work the system.  While the presidents are terrible, I think having a dem will help in congress and on the supreme court"
1418,"I believe in Hillary Clinton because she has the political expertise and experience.  She is knowledgeable regarding the issues and more importantly understand the issues and how they can be solved.  Donald Trump is an evil, conniving narcissist who is only concerned with himself.  He has insulted to many minority groups and does not get a pass. He does not articulate nor discuss the issues with any great knowledge and resorts to name calling and throwing tantrums when he does not get his way.  He has openly lied and made derogatory comments and when called out on it, he laughs it off as a joke. Being the Commander in Chief of the USA is no joking matter. I cannot take him seriously!  "
1419,"I feel Hillary represents an establishment that has quashed our choices for representation and steers us in the direction they want us to go.  I feel Donald is the very antithesis of that.  Although I don't agree with all his positions (I never have with any candidate ever by the way) I prefer the concept of getting a real people's candidate not one the Democratic Convention shoved down our throats.  All my children of legal voting age have penciled in Bernie Sanders, which I understand and yet makes me sad, as they have in fact, thrown away their vote.  Their brief moment of rebellion will never be noticed by anyone because the computer reading their ballot can neither compute nor notice their rebellion."
1420,"Neither of the candidate is perfect, but Donald Trump is worse in all areas of competency and moral standard."
1421,"I think the two party system is broken. They are 2 sides of the same coin. If I had to chose, I would pick Trump because he is an outsider."
1422,I think somewhere along the line america has lost the ball.  We are losing our values and what we stand for.  We are turning into a huge welfare state.
1423,"I don't like Donald Trump as a candidate at all.  Him as a president would be horrible for me personally and the country as a whole.  Probably the whole world, too, with his opinions on environmentalism and foreign relations. /  / Hillary Clinton is definitely not perfect, either.  Her opinion seems to change with public opinion, and it is not clear whether she genuinely believes what she says (I am okay with a politician who honestly changes her mind) or whether she is just pandering to what she thinks people want.  However, she does have a history of advocating for inclusion of children with disabilities in public schools and pushing for improved access to healthcare, which I respect. /  / Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, etc do not take the campaign seriously, so I see no need to have any views on them."
1424,"I believe Trump is for the people, and hilliary is not. I believe Hillary is a liar and can not be trusted to be our president. I am more worried about what she has done than what Trump has said. I will be voting for trump."
1425,I think they are both shady and unqualified and as such I will be voting for the Libertarian candidate.
1426,"I agreed with the author that Hillary seems guarded and false.  What she says she believes, what she DOES believe, and what someone else has TOLD her to act like she believes are three different things.  I don't want that in a leader.  Trump might be chastised by and apologized for by all of the people around him but he isn't actually changed by them in a way different than the average American is changed by discussion about beliefs.  He is much more honest.  And we see more of what his 'team' believes because of the bungles and apologies and mayhem then the cold calculating 'train' of Hillary's campaign that seems sinister and plotted, following party lines and threats."
1427,"Hillary wouldn't have seemed such a bad option, until Bernie reminded progressives of what is possible. Although I am a feminist, and hold a B.S. in Women's Studies, and voted for Bill twice, I cannot overcome the visceral dislike and mistrust I feel for HRC. I believe she is deeply corrupt, and without Bill's charm to help you overlook that. Although I believe she is qualified, and is clearly a total policy wonk, she is not the first woman president most of my generation hoped for.  /  / The Donald seems to be a megalomaniac who could benefit from medication. I'm deeply appalled - & stunned - that he is able to simply repeat things that are blatantly factually incorrect...and it has no impact on his followers. I am deeply uneasy with the tone of his rallies and his lack of responsibility for the volatile outcomes."
1428,"I am very happy to see a woman up for election to be the POTUS, but the fact that Donald Trump is on the ballot is extremely disheartening. He is everything that is wrong with this country and the fact that he has so many followers makes me very sad and angry. "
1429,Donald Trump is unpredictable and a little crazy but actually says what's on his mind.  Right or wrong you understand where he is coming from.  Hillary Clinton is a pathological liar that will say and do anything for power and money.  She cares only about herself and no one or any organization.  I often would tell my children growing up.  Who would you rather live with:  A liar or a murderer?  I always told them a murderer because I knew what they were and a liar I could never tell.  Hillary is the liar.  
1430,Not for Clinton. She is part of the agenda like Obama. She will continue with the plan to disarm America and the NEW WORLD ORDER / GLOBALIZATION. She is pure evil. Trump is exposing all of that. I'd rather live in Asia or Russia. 
1431,"Donald Trump is scum. Hillary Clinton cannot be trusted, and is running out of a sense that ""it's her turn"". Both of them should be set from in the middle of a desert with no food or water and vultures overhead waiting to free the american people from their misery."
1432,"I will never vote for Hillary Clinton after what she did to our people in Benghazi. I am not saying Trump is perfect, but he has never caused the deaths of innocent people. "
1433,"I dislike both HRC and DJTon a p[ersonal level. I would not invite either to my house for dinner. HRC is a lying, manipulative pwer-hugry individual who cares little about people and only about herself and her success. She is viewed as the victim of WJC's lies and immoral behavior, yet she waas the one who always led the defense of him for her own personal reasons of maintainning personal power. / DJT is a big businessman who puts $ in front of treating people correctly. He is an egomaniac, who was taught by his mentor Roy Cohn to attack everyone who's against you. Trump could screw things up, but if he does, in 2020 Democrats will elect a compentent progressive who will move us forward."
1434,"Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump have good intentions as president. However, my views are mostly compatible with Clinton's view than Trump's view. For example, I oppose tax cuts in the economy since Tax us extremely important for the funding of many renovations/activities."
1435,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are both horrible candidates, but at least Trump isn't an untrustworthy insider and he actually cares about the everyday American."
1436,"I feel that Hillary Clinton is the best choice this election because she is intelligent, well-spoken, and very experienced. She knows the ins and outs of the political world and I agree with her stances on healthcare, women's rights, the economy, and globalization.  /  / On the other hand, I feel very distraught that Trump is even an option for any political office, much less the presidency. He speaks crudely and unintelligently, is offensive and a bully. He has yet to reveal any detailed policies and honestly, there are too many parallels between Trump and Hitler. He uses many of the propaganda techniques that Hitler used to take Germany's elections and that makes me extremely uncomfortable, especially as a minority and as a woman."
1437,"Trump is an absolute idiotic, racist, sexist man and it would be extremely dangerous to have him in the white house. Clinton has lots of experience and has the best interests of the middle and lower class. "
1438,"I believe HIllary is extremely qualified to be president, though she has some flaws (as do most people).  However, I believe she is intelligent and able to lead our country as the first female president.  Conversely, I feel Donald Trump is coarse, unreliable, misogynistic, and would be an unacceptable president due to his inability to take responsibility for his actions, his terrifying views about women, and his inability to work with others, including his vice presidential candidate- all things a president has to do every day."
1439,"Clinton is an experienced politician whose policy positions are generally aligned with mine. Trump has little political experience, and his policy positions are not in alignment with mine."
1440,Trump is extremely dangerous. Clinton can be trusted to do the job of President.
1441,Neither have many good qualities. Have to hope the lesser of two evils wins. It is a shame.
1442,I like Donald Trump because he's not a politician. /  / I like Hillary Clinton because she doesn't make a fool out of herself and has decent positions that I agree with.
1443,Donald Trump is vulgar and offensive.  He's not someone I would want my grandchildren watching.  He scares me and it scares me even more that so many people are behind him.  I don't understand why anyone would be behind him.  I'm not terribly fond of Hillary Clinton either.  I do feel she's closer to my own mindset on the direction our country needs to go.  
1444,"Trump scares me, he has shown in the past that he does not prepare for meetings and instead states off the cuff one-liners.  These one-liners show his ignorance.  How he treats others after he moves on (stabs them in the back) is how he will treat others (our allies or enemies he needs to negotiate with).  He says ""Trust me"" as if that wins every argument.  It didn't work with my military recruiter, doubt it will work with my President."
1445,I have voted for Clinton because Bernie Sander isn't the democratic nominee and I felt I had to. Trump is a blatant racist. Clinton isn't a blatant racist so I voted for her. 
1446,I think that hillary clinton represents positivity inide our world and that donald trump represents the negative. If we on nov 8th fail to choose the best candidate I think our happiness may be in jeopardy.
1447,"Clinton is a good, imperfect, pragmatic candidate. Trump is a narcissistic dumpster fire."
1448,"Trump is inexperienced for public office, let alone being president. He has his own interests in mind. Hillary has experience and knowledge to lead us. She has the interests and well being of all Americans not just the super rich."
1449,Trump is flamboyant and unpredictable / Clinton is an insider and well connected
1450,"I don't care for hillary, she is aliar and should be punished for those emails. lets not forget obama care, which she supports. I have a sick child at home, you know how much we pay a month just for prescriptions? how are people supposed to live like that? / Trump is very straight forward, even though he has money, his demeaner is that of the average joe. He could watch his language a bit more, but I'm all for free healthcare."
1451,I feel that if trump is elected there will probably be a war and a collapse of society. Hillary Clinton is not perfect by no means but she has the experience that is needed for such an important job. Trump will be the end of the world as we know it in my opinion.
1452,Both of them are awful but Trump and his VP are devils. They don't care about me or anyone like me
1453,"Hillary Clinton is a very experienced politician, she has foreign policy experience and knows how to get things done. She also has moderate views on most issues and seems like she would move the country in the right direction. Trump has said outrageous things and has no political experience, he also doesn't seem to think through the things he says. Overall he does not seem fit to be president. "
1454,I don't feel that Clinton is the best or even a very candidate to lead the country but I would much rather have her as president than Trump.
1455,Trump is clueless and delusional. Out for his own gain. Clinton at least addresses issues.
1456,"Hillary has engaged in illegal activity multiple times over the year to further her own self interest.  I don't believe every thing lodged at her she has probably done, but there is such a mountain of things that some to many are likely true.  I believe there is plenty of evidence to support that, and I don't think she will be a president with anything in mind but her own self interest.  I don't think Trump will do all he claims, no one could, and he has to have the help of the senate and house, but I do think his ideas help every day Americans much more than hurts them.  No one knows for certain what kind of President he will be, but I much more believe his record as a businessman makes him qualified and has given him experience to bring people together to discuss, an ability to negotiate, and an understanding of what makes positive financial sense that can translate to the country and citizens."
1457,"I don't trust Hillary, and I don't like her stance on gun control, abortion or much else.  I don't really like Donald Trump's character as a person, but I respect his business experience and his stance on gun control and the position he could be in to nominate conservative justices for the Supreme Court.  That's what is motivating me to vote for Donald Trump."
1458,"I believe Hillary Clinton is strong, experienced, and balanced.  She has a cool head and knows how to work with people for solutions.  I think the claims against her are quite overblown and dramatic.  Bottom line is she has the experience and intelligence to do a great job for our country.  I think Donald Trump is a disgusting person.  He has no political experiences and hold antiquated views about society and people.  He is not current with the times and is unbalanced.  He reacts emotionally which is immature and dangerous for a person of power. "
1459,I think Donald Trump can be trusted more because he speaks his mind more than Hillary Clinton. I think with this type of attribute he can be trusted far more than the other candidates.
1460,I believe that Hillary Clinton knows what she is doing. She has the knowledge to run the country. Donald Trump is only concerned with himself. He is only running because of his inflated ego. 
1461,I feel that Hilary Clinton really cares and is compassionate about us citizens and is wanting to push forward for a better life ahead. Donald Trump is psychotic and delusional in his values and way of thinking. His goals are not for the masses. 
1462,I don't like Trump or Clinton. They are both proven liars and are only in it for themselves.
1463,I do not fully believe that any candidate is fit to be president
1464,"I believe Hillary Clinton is hiding stuff in her emails and I feel she cannot be trusted. She supports the wrong ideals for America and is in it for herself. I believe Donald Trump is a much better choice because he is not afraid to voice his opinion, and I feel his has our best interests at heart."
1465,"Both candidates are not ideal presidential material. One is very immature, hypocritical, and scandalous. The other is a liar, corrupt, and should be indicted. They appear to support their voters, but only say words to gain votes. It's hard to trust them in actually representing their voters voices."
1466,Politics is very complex process. Hillary is knowledgeable with the system and she serve in public offices Trump did not.
1467,I believe Hillary Clinton is a much more qualified candidate. I believe Donald Trump lacks the maturity and judgment to be president.
1468,"They are both evil, it is just which is the lesser of the two evils. I am ashamed that these are our two candidates to choose from."
1469,"While Clinton's email server scandal is definitely regrettable, Trump is no where near qualified to be president.  His understanding of every issue is largely superficial and I cringe to think of him representing USA in any foreign affair."
1470,"I think they are both awful.  Both are criminals, both are self-centered egotists, and I would never vote for either of them.  A pox on them and the parties that nominated them."
1471,They are both terrible. They are completely out of touch with reality. The entire system is just a show. 
1472,"I think that Donald Trump is a vile person. He is racist, sexist, and xenophobic, depite his insistence that he isn't. He's also commited sexual assault. How those characteristics can represent our country in the way that I think we ought to be, I haven't the slightest clue. All that is before one looks at how completely ill-equipped he is to serve in office. He is not a politician, which could be seen as positive, but his behavior has shown that he isn't capable of carrying himself in a diplomatic fashion that would improve or maintain international relationships. His wealth also makes him untrustworthy. /  / Hillary Clinton is much better than Trump, but still far more flawed than I am comfortable. She has not been consistent on her political views over the last twenty years, she is dishonest and she has shown poor judgement. She, too, comes from big money and a powerful family name. It's difficult for me to see how individuals with those privileges can have my interests in mind, or the collective interests of the country. /  / Both candidates have been or will be under serious investigations at some point during or immediately after the election. I look back at history and can't think of a time when there were two less likeable candidates as the only options."
1473,"I have gone back and forth on my views towards the candidates, but I have consistently known that I do not wish to vote Hillary Clinton into office. I am looking for a good alternative."
1474,"There are some candidates who will get this country back on track - unfortunately, this will never happen because people are brainwashed into voting for the two mainstream parties."
1475,"I believe Donald Trump, although rash and often harsh, can turn America around especially for the working middle class. Hillary is working to gain the votes of minorities even though she has worked against them in the past. Hillary comes from a line of corrupt politicians, I believe Trump is not the greatest but something new and someone who can change this corruptness in our government "
1476,"I think Clinton should win because she cares about people and has the most experience to get the job done right. I think Trump is selfish, sexist, racist and can not be trusted."
1477,"I think niether candidate is the best, but I think the United States is screwed if Donald Trump gets elected. He will make things worse than they already are. Hillary is the best choice that we have for our country."
1478,"They're both extremely flawed, awful human beings completely unfit to be president. Hillary rigged her own primary to get in and Donald Trump is a madman pandering to millions of illiterate Americans. I'm embarrassed to be an American after this election, regardless of the outcome. "
1479,"Hillary Clinton  is the best choice for President.   She's qualified, smart and capable.   She's been a public servant most of her life.   She's concerned for everyday Americans and she's keep us safe. "
1480,"This is a very scary election, and it's down to the better of the two evils.  I'm viewing it as who is going to cause the least amount of damage.At least Bill has Hillary's back."
1481,"Donald Trump is a complete idiot who can't run his over business rather this country. Hillary Clinton is a bought out evil corporate robot who does what the money says. To be honest, lets keep Obama in. "
1482,"Hillary is corrupt, she owes too many people favors, and she is just too old for the job.  I don't think she'll make it past her first term without being impeached. / Trump is a fascist sociopath. / I can't stand either of them, that's why I voted for Gary Johnson."
1483,Both are crooks and liars.  I can't support either one.  I will vote for Johnson.
1484,I think both candidates are a joke! 
1485,i am worried that trump is making promises he cant or wont keep.and clinton will be more of the same old stuff that doesnt work.and the independents wont get enough votes.maybe voting really is a waste of time.
1486,"I am a staunch Libertarian and I voted for Gary Johnson. /  / Hillary is a loose cannon who covers up her husband's sexual harassment and out and out rape while her supporters call out folks who ""victim shame"" Trump's alleged victims. /  / Trump has some good ideas here and there and on the upside, he says what he thinks but on the downside, he can't control his mouth which is a problem on the international stage. /  / Both are statist in the extreme and neither are particularly fit to be president."
1487,I don't want to answer this question 
1488,I support hillary clinton / I hate donald trump
1489,I AM VERY ANTI TRUMP!  I WILL BE VOTING FOR HILARY SIMPLY BECAUSE TRUMP IS A FAR WORSE CHOICE.
1490,I feel like Trump is highly sexist..whereas Clinton agrees with abortion and I do NOT agree with abortion.
1491,"I was a Bernie Sanders supporter from the beginning and have alwasy been a Liberal.  /  / I was not a big Hillary Clinton supporter but I do believe she has the qualifications to fulfill the role of the Presidency. /  / I believe Donald Trump is an un-diagnosed sociopath, or quite possibly, not even human."
1492,"Trump is emotional, intellectual, and physically unfit to be president.  He is a reality show star that has the intellectual capacity of a 5th grader.  His inability to convey his policies or plan for change is sad and disingenuous.  He is an egomanic and preaches hatred and has tapped into a deep underlined fear that is prominent in the country.  He has never done anything for middle class or poor people except take their money."
1493,"While i was a strong Bernie Sanders supporter during the primaries, I will be electing to vote for Hillary Clinton in this upcoming election.  I feel that Hillary is the most appropriate choice for our country's well being and growth."
1494,"I am not in favor of both candidates, Clinton has had a very negative history with no signs of improvement over the years. Trump is not very realistic he has made some outrageous claims. I think that both candidates never gave any solid answers to any of the questions they had, it was more of a TV show in which they both bickered at each other. I am more toward Johnson simply because he has more history in politics and has done some forms of improvement. "
1495,"I have no illusions about Trump, I don't think he's really that concerned about blue collar workers in industrial states. On the other hand, Hillary has no real plans for fixing a damn thing, if she did I'd vote for her. She and Bill have gotten rich from being in politics for decades, now Hillary wants her time in power because just being rich isn't enough. I believe she instinctively hides things, maybe from habit due to political enemies, and she doesn't care anything about people like me. Neither does Trump, he's a liar too. On the other hand, maybe he doesn't present himself so well bc he's had less practice than Clinton."
1496,I disagree with a lot of what both of them stand for. 
1497,"I think Trump is a terrible candidate, but that Clinton is corrupt. I'm voting for Gary Johnson because I agree with his views and think he would make a competent leader for our country. "
1498,"clinton is pro choice and pro women,, which is a huge factor for me to consider. trump hates muslims, women and a lot of minority groups and is extremely dangerous."
1499,Donald Trump is a fake who is only out for his own gain whether it be monetary or emotional. Hillary will guard the interests of the people of the USA. There has been so much effort to discredit her that I wonder who is afraid of her and why.
1500,"I think Hillary is too shady to be trusted with representing and acting on what the American people want. It seems like every time she gains responsibility, she corruptly screws it up ending in failure and some kind of death. I think Trump's ego could get in the way of his leadership but there is a strong likelihood that he will surround himself with people who can help him do a great job. "
1501,"Trump is an idiot and unqualified to even be a candidate. / Clinton is a well qualified candidate who understand that incremental change is how meaningful, long lasting change is made in our government. Though she comes off as being cold or pandering to interests, she is not as untrustworthy as most people think; rather that just goes to show how well the right wing media has dragged her through the mud."
1502,"I believe that they both suck, however thankfully there are some checks and balances to prevent anything too drastic. I believe that a majority of this election is related to trends in media. I see countless people shifting sides / sharing articles, just because it makes them look knowledgeable. Ive seen people share stuff that on the surface supports trump, but realisticly upon reading, supports hillary. People are just want to look involved."
1503,I feel that the Donald Trump will cause the country to go into crisis. I think that Hillary will make our county work better for everyone.
1504,"Neither candidate has my respect which is a big shame. They are no doubt successful individuals, but they are very flawed human beings.  Quite honestly I trust Hilary Clinton to only make mistakes, not to fail.  Donald trump would fail at being president and severely erode confidence in our country."
1505,My thoughts about the candidates vary from person to person. Donald Trump is honest about the future and the welfare of our children and the poor in the inner cities while Hillary Clinton is somewhat a supporter of immigration. Johnson and Stein have very little or nothing to bring to the table of politics. Trump wants strong borders while Clinton wants to break barriers to all nationalities. My choice is for Trump because he has the moxie and Clinton has the special interests and lobbyist.. Trump needs to become president to solve a lot of problems that our country is having today.. Trump can make us a lot of money and bring our second admendment right out of siege..
1506,Donald Trump will make America great again / Hilliary Clinton will give our country over to terrorists
1507,"I think that Hilary's ability to stay calm in stressful situations will be an asset to the country. I think that Donald Trump lacks the empathy needed to be able to work with and for people that don't always share his exact views. I think he could be more tactful in the way he shares his viewpoints. Somethings that he says are completely outrageous and irrational. When it comes to our national security, I want someone in office who can get along with other people."
1508,I don't have a particular opinion on any of them. I would like to see Hilary win because she is a female and it would be neat to have two Clinton's in the White House. I would like to see Trump because I think he genuinely feels passionate about his ideas. 
1509,"I believe that Donald Trump is doing a lot of what he is doing for attention, while I believe that Hillary actually wants to become president to change the country. I don't think that Trump can be trusted to progress the country in a liberal, forward moving way."
1510,"The thought of people voting for Clinton is beyond me.  In an age of information, people are still ignorant of her corrupt, deceptive actions and negligence of our national security.  We are not voting between a Democrat and Republican this election, we are voting between absolute globalism and the future of our democracy."
1511,"I think that there is no right choice between the two major party candidates, however, I have less trust in Hillary than I do in Donald.  I am optimistic that we can survive the next 4 years and a better choice will be available at that time."
1512,"trump is a magalomaniacal monster who has taken the joke that is his campaign too far. Hillary is a reasonable choice for president, a fact which I have to keep reminding myself as her campaign and name are dragged through the mud. I love Bernie Sanders, and I voted for him in the primaries."
1513,"I honestly hate both of them.  Hillary is a typical slimy politician who's only concerned with herself.  I think she can't be trusted, but she won't do too much either.  She's a politician, so nothing much will change, and I can live with that.  Trump, on the other hand is the most insane person I've ever seen run for office and I genuinely fear a country with him as president.  He doesn't remain calm and is full of hot air.  He has no political experience, and every single one of his plans is ""I'm the best and I'll do it the best"" for whatever you ask him.  No substance whatsoever.  I think he will get power crazy and get us into WAY more trouble than Hillary would. "
1514,"i prefer Hilary over Donald, especially since I think he is very reacist and only out for himself. "
1515,"I honestly think we are screwed either way. Trump is in it for himself, and Clinton is in it to make money and appease the big companies."
1516,I'm all for trump. Hillary shouldn't be running.
1517,"I honestly preferred Ben Carson. I voted for Donald Trump because he's the better choice. We've had enough career politicians, we need a businessman; I especially want a businessman who has failed previously (bankruptcy etc) and COME BACK FROM IT. I would never see a situation to vote for Clinton short of having Stalin/Hitler/etc as opposition."
1518,"I don't like either one. As usual, have to pick between the lesser of two evils. Hillary can't be trusted to know her rear end from a hole in the wall."
1519,"Both are awful candidates. An independent of course won't win. If Bernie Sanders were in the running still I maybe would have voted for him. I don't feel it will make too much of a difference regardless of who is president though. Trump is going to try to help the rich more in a time where wealth inequality is at its highest, and Hillary is just another corrupt politician taking bribes. I would not vote for either of them, and I don't feel voting for an independent is worth the effort. "
1520,Hillary is the lesser of evils
1521,"Very supportive of Hillary Clinton even though she has been dishonest is some situations but is the most qualified.  Trump on the other hand is basically a rude, disguising, not presidential at all. "
1522,"Each candidate is pushing for their personal agenda and not looking at the bigger picture.  We need a motivational leader, who can bring a change to our economy and help us grow to our full potential."
1523,"I preferred Bernie Sanders to win the democratic nomination and then win the presidency, but unfortunately he did not win against Hillary Clinton.  I suppose Hillary is closer to Bernie than Donald Trump is, and that is the primary reason why I will probably be voting for Hillary.  Not because I particularly favour her over any other candidate, but that she is in my opinion the most overall similar to Bernie.  "
1524,"I think Hillary Clinton has the experience and temperament to lead the country!  Trump, hopefully packs up his toys and goes home! "
1525,Donald trump is dangerous and irrational without any skills. Hillary is by far the most experienced but has her flaws for sure. 
1526,i have not really followed the election. donald trump has business skills that will help the us. hilary i believe is just about being the first woman president.
1527,I believe that Hillary is not what's best for our country and is more about appearances.  She has been caught in several lies and says what is necessary at the time.  Donald Trump is honestly even if people do not like his views.  We need someone tough to lead the American People. 
1528,I do not trust nor like Hillary Clinton. I think she is a self centered dangerous criminal who is in this race for power and to continue things along the same horrible path. Trump has no need for power as he has plenty in his business and personal life. He does not need the money nor this job as his life has everything he could possible want or need and none of the hassles of running our country. I believe he is in this race for the right reasons and thus will do great things for our country and our people. 
1529,I believe that Trump is dangerous to not only America but also the world because of his hateful diatribe and views. Hillary is not my first choice for President but I believe she can maintain a good quality of life for all if she is elected.
1530,"I believe Trump is either crazy, lying, or only in it for the attention. I believe Clinton is too corrupt to be trusted."
1531,I am hoping that the parties can come together and compromise on things and focus on improving our country rather than tearing it apart.
1532,"Donald Trump has shown time and time again his incompetency and I just do not want a president who allows himself to act this way. Hillary Clinton is the lesser of the two evils as she also is guilty of incompetency, however; I believe in her viewpoint much more than Trump."
1533,"Hillary Clinton understands how law and government works.  Donald Trump understands how big business works.  In order to run this country effectively, I believe we would have someone in office who understand bureaucracy to the fullest extent.  Their personalities and mistakes are irrelevant at this point.  I believe Donald Trump would make a mockery of the US- as it appears to other countries.  He is a strong character with strong opinions and some guts.  But he lacks tact, knowledge and skills in diplomacy.  "
1534,"Donald Trump, while an outsider, is not running for office for any reason other than self-interest.  Hillary Clinton is a career-politician who's platform has been influenced by big corporations and a politicall history of missteps.  "
1535,"I feel that someone like Hillary Clinton, who is currently under FBI investigation and who may lose her security clearance shouldn't be allowed to run for election. How can a person like this, who has obviously lied and hidden things from the government and the people be trusted to lead the US in a place it needs to go. /  / I don't think that Trump is the best candidate out there but I think he is the best available to us currently.  I like the fact that the man can actually run a business and I have no problem with his taxes. If people do not like him being able to claim losses on his taxes, they should change the tax system, not get pissed off when someone has a good tax accountant and fully utilizes all portions of the tax code, that is just asinine. "
1536,"Both candidates are bad. But if I'm going to pick between the lesser or two evils, I'll vote for Trump. One is a failed businessman, the other is a liar and a thief. At least Trump is honest."
1537,"Although Clinton seems shady and untrustworthy, I believe Donald is a great deal worse. He doesn't seem very politically intelligent to me, and aiding the economy seems to be his only strength. He also seems very hypocritical to me. He constantly accuses Hilary for her previous views and denies any claim of a view that he had previously (ie. global warming myth.) It just seems that in general, Trump would be a lot worse. As a person with liberal views, Clinton is the lesser of two very big evils. "
1538,Clinton is a vile human being who brings shame to feminists. Trump is a warm man who will make this country great.
1539,Hillary Clinton has a history of blatant corruption. Her time as Secretary of State is criminal in my opinion due to her handling of e mails on a private server. We simply do not know the damage that was done because of that yet. Of course there is Benghazi where 4 Americans were left to die. I choose to listen to individuals such as Kris Paronto that were actually there. Donald Trump on the other hand can be a complete idiot because of the things that he says. It leads me to wonder what that would do to our standing with allies in the world. 
1540,NA
1541,"Hillary Clinton is the only candidate intelligent and honest enough to run thius country. Truymp is vain, egotistical, insane liar."
1542,Hillary sucks bad / Trump sucks some
1543,Well I will sure vote for Hilary Clinton on Tuesday because Democratic party is the best.
1544,I think Trump's an idiot and Hilary's corrupt. You can't trust either one.
1545,I am on the fence between the two candidates. I think they are both off in my opinion and there are better options. 
1546,"They're both not good overall , Hillary is very dishonest, provenly involved in corruption, satanic rituals amongst other unethical dealings. Donald is too egotistical and 'wild ' but seems better inside"
1547,"Mr. Trump does not come off at all to me as presidential. I think he is a narcissist and is only in this to help himself. While Mrs. Clinton is not perfect, I feel we would be much safer with her in the oval office than Donald Trump."
1548,Hillary Clinton is a liar.  She owes lots of favors to big donors that will influence legislation.  Donald trump is not a seasoned politician and will work more for the average American.
1549,"I'm not a fan of either of the two main candidates for President, however between the tow of them I don't believe that there is a choice.  In my opinion, of the two, the only one that is qualified to be President is Clinton.  While I question her judgement, there is no doubt that she has the experience necessary to do the job. Trump on the other hand doesn't have the temperament or the political experience to be trusted with the nation's top job and the nuclear codes that come with it.  I honestly am concerned that his temper will put us on the brink of war with someone around the world. "
1550,"While I think Donald has some useful ideas about the economy, he is terrifyingly under qualified to be president and may or may not be a child rapist. Hillary has an excessive amount of experience and is qualified, but also has questionable morals. However, I feel safer under a Clinton presidency as an LGBT individual to retain my right to marry some day, and also to not be thrown into wars."
1551,"I am supporting Hillary Clinton for president.  I believe she has the knowledge and expertise to lead the country.  This is a critical time for America, and we need someone who knows what they are doing."
1552,"On a political level they are both corrupt, and both their foundations are corrupt. On a personal level Donald Trump is a pretty repulsive human being, whereas I don't know anything that's been proven against Clinton. I think both of them are almost equally terrible choices for president. If I had to spend an hour or two in either's company, it would be Clinton for sure. "
1553,"Trump is an egotistical showman who is in it for the money. So is Clinton. Clinton, however, will do less harm while practicing her ways."
1554,"I believe neither is a good choice, but Trump will be less destructive than Hilary.  I think she is a proven criminal, while he is potentially dangerous to our economy.  He is the lesser of two evils, in my opinion."
1555,"We have two terrible options but one is worse than the other. For that reason, Donald Trump must be stopped and our only choice is Hillary Clinton. She has the experience necessary and she is just as shady as a lot of politicians. "
1556,"Donald Trump is a toxic threat to our society. Very few people--white men--stand to benefit from his presidency. I fear the safety of women, the lgbt+ community, Mexicans, Muslims, and african americans, will all be compromised. Hillary may not be ideal for many people, but at least she will not set our country back 50 years. "
1557,"By the candidates, I assume you mean Trump and Clinton. Clinton is your bog-standard corrupt politician making back-room deals like she breathes, and wants nothing more than to be president for its own sake, but at least she *also* cares about the fate of the country, and while I don't agree with all her positions, and certainly don't like her as a person, at least I agree with *some* of her positions, and think she'll generally do no worse than average of a job as president.  /  / Trump is a overbearing, megalomaniacal idiot, a little bit of a racist, definitely a womanizing creep, thinks he knows everything about everything but actually botches everything he touches, is physically incapable of being diplomatic for even a second, and in general, could well go down as one of the worst presidents ever if he wins. "
1558,"I see nothing but narcissism, untreated mental illness, and angry insecurity in Donald Trump.  Makes for a dangerous commander in chief.  Also makes a true choice in voting null.  "
1559,"I believe it is a pivotal time to be an American and as most would agree, we are in a big rut with our presidential elections "
1560,I think they are both not very good candidates. Both have many flaws. I feel trump is a bully and has no right or training to run our country.
1561,"both should openly admit when they have done wrong, and rather than focus on judging the fate and flaws of the other's past wrongs in retaliation, focus on what they can do this time around to correct a situation, by learning from previous mistakes, work to provide a movement of progression of self and state, and and move in a positive direction based on the experiences and humiliations of the past.  Don't hide your intentions. "
1562,"I do not trust Hillary Clinton.  Liberals seem to believe she is being ""picked on"" through all the allegations of wrong doing that seem to have followed her entire career. Conservatives have already convicted her of some or all of the things that she has been accused of doing. Personally, I have disliked her since Bill was elected president and one of the first things I heard was that Hillary was going to fix the health care system. My thought was - when was Hillary elected, I never saw her name on the ballot. /  / Donald Trump is an idiot. He is rich, has always been rich and has no idea how the middle class functions. His temper makes him at least somewhat dangerous. I kept thinking his campaign was a joke, that no reasonable person could actually support him. The joke has turned into a nightmare - its either an ego-maniac nut like Trump or completely untrustworthy and likely criminal in Clinton. I'll support neither and sleep better for it."
1563,"Donald Trump, it's hard to say how awful he is.  He's a racist, possibly a rapist, he has no actual plans or facts to how he'd ""make America great again"", and the only thing I can applaud on his account is his ability to wrangle in the idiots of the USA.  Hillary Clinton has experience in politics, brings the female aspect in which is exciting, and has plans and goals that are reachable for the USA even if I don't believe in them.  I believe in strategy and she can at least offer that.  I've already voted for Jill Stein as I agree with her on more issues that either of the main candidates."
1564,"I am a Hillary Clinton supporter as I am generally a supporter of the Democratic party and it's candidates. I may have preferred a ""new blood"" candidate such as one of the Castro brothers or even Tim Kaine but I have a always admired Hillary Clinton to a degree. I detest Donald Trump even more than I do the typical Republican presidential candidate but do not necessarily consider a majority of his supporters to be ""evil"" but simply misguided. "
1565,"Donald Trump is the only candidate who isn't owned by big business because he is the big business. He has been relatively honest and transparent and he is extremely patriotic. He genuinely cares about the people that surrounds him and he is rich enough that he doesn't need the stress of running for presidency.  /  / Hilary is a career politician who is corrupt. The Wikileaks leaks have done a great job and exposing the common folk into how corrupt and twisted this woman is. Her and the DNC have conspired and done dirty deeds in order to secure her candidacy, including media manipulation and other forms of corruption. This woman is slap to the face of democracy. "
1566,"Both candidates are lack trust of the people, people are choosing allegiance based on what the other candidate has done. Instead of choosing A candidate based on what they plan to do. Allegiance to political party is all people see."
1567,Trump is a know-nothing asshole. Hillary can do the job with the normal amount of political BS.
1568,"I think Trump is the best choice. How can anyone vote for someone who mishandled classified information and let 4 people die in Benghazi? She is a pathological liar and has been proven to lie about anything, even while under oath. Trump isn't perfect, but he has a far better vision than Clinton."
1569,"Donald Trump will turn the presidency into a reality TV show.  Hillary Clinton represents and speaks to the issues that are important to me.  Equal pay for women, equal rights for women, Roe v Wade, race and gender equality.  I believe in socialized medicine and I believe that Hillary Clinton can reform, not repeal the Affordable Care Act"
1570,"I think Trump incites radicalism from white trash rednecks. He promotes people to act on anger towards minorities. He operates under the guise of patriotism to get republican voters to stand with him. I do not think he personally has the extremist views that he discusses. I think he says plays on the emotions of republican voters who don't like the minorities in the communities. In reality, I believe that he knows exactly what to say to get those people to vote for him--I don't think he truly plans to build a wall or deny all Muslims entry to the US. I don't think Clinton can be trusted because she often changes her opinion on matters and seems as though she can be ""bought"" by large corporations.  "
1571,I don't like either of the candidates I think neither options are viable at all. I just wish I'd have registered to vote sooner. I won't be able to vote now.
1572,I am very disheartened by both candidates.  I believe Hillary Clinton is a lying and corrupt individual.  I believe Donald Trump is a thin skinned narcissist who will look out for his own interests first and cares absolutely nothing about average Americans.  
1573,"I go to vote Tuesday with a heavy heart and a mind void of hope. My vote is going to be for Hilliary, because I think her experience and temperment will keep us out of a nuclear blow out a little longer than Trump would. I fear Trumps inability to control his need for revenge, his need to hit back, his bullying tactics and impulsive reactions will not bode well for us. They both are shady of character, and have got away with activities that should be criminal, but because they are merely unethical and not illegal, they waltz along wearing their delusional laurels of goodness and hope, when by their actions they have proven to both have very very very bad judgement."
1574,I don't think Clinton is perfect. She has her own flaws.  But she is far better than Trump who I very much dislike.  He huffs and puffs and says he's going to blow a house down but he actual decision making skills are horrible.  His opinions are different than my own where as Clinton's are closer to mine.  I see Clinton as the lesser of two evils.
1575,It's very difficult to get an accurate view of the candidates through all of the propaganda and mud slinging that the media is throwing at us. I feel that any presidential candidate has their work cut out for them and they will never be 100% liked no matter what they do. I feel that there are a lot of issues being forgotten or underrepresented in this election. There are too many issues in our country for any one president to fix. We must all be patient and make sure that we are doing our research outside from what we hear in the media or what the candidates are telling us. 
1576,"I honestly think both candidates aren't the best choices but I think Clinton is a better fit. Clinton has already been working in the White House for years, built relationships and knows some of the facts unlike Trump. Trump is disrespectful to women, minorities, LGBT community, etc. "
1577,"My views on the candidates is that they are both not the greatest candidates ever, but at the same time there is clearly someone who is better than the other. I feel the Donald trump is dangerous and is not stable enough to make decision that could make war, education, or other important choices. "
1578,"I think there is no ideal candidate because they both have problems. On one side, you have a long, extensive political record and experience with two 4-year terms spent inside the White House. There are issues when it comes to neutrality with donations to groups, but it's not excessive. On another side, you have inexperience in the political world yet a deep understanding of industry and how America works. This candidate may have no filter when it comes to speaking how he feels about certain issues and others. However there is a danger that comes with not knowing how politics works on a large scale and trying too hard to make changes to society is simply unrealistic. People want change and I understand that, but I'm going with the more experienced choice, even if there are trust/security/classified information handling issues."
1579,I believe Clinton is a corrupt indivual who has no buisness saying she advocates for children at the same time saying abortion and late term abortion should be leagal. I think Trump while arrogrant has the best interest of our country and finances and people at heart.
1580,"I do not trust Clinton and feel if she were to be elected, it would be a negative experience for this country. I do not think she could be trusted. I lean more toward Trump in this election. However, i will admit, it is like choosing between the lesser evil during this election. I feel very disappointed in both candidates and can't wait for the 2020 election."
1581,"I am a big proponent of social and human rights. I believe that we should be more tolerate of one another, especially those that have a different background than us or that are of a different culture. I don't believe that Donald Trump over the years has made this a priority in the way he lives his life or runs his businesses. I believe he is very out of touch with the middle class. On the other had I respect the professional credentials of Hillary Clinton, here defense of social injustices and her connection with the middle class."
1582,Great candidates
1583,Clinton is a liar and a typical career politician.  We need change.  Trump can bring that change.
1584,"I don't trust Clinton, she has been involved in highly questionable businesses dealings for the last two decades, and has profited enormously from her and her husband's governmental positions. Trump, while inexperienced, is an outsider we I think can shake things up for the better. "
1585,trump all the way
1586,NA
1587,"I do not support Donald Trump and have attempted to dissuade others from voting for him.  I'm registered unenrolled but voted Kasich in the primaries as a form of Trump protest vote.  Hillary Clinton, in my view, is a qualified technocrat who brings less uncertainty,"
1588,Hillary is an evil and corrupt candidate who has proven over and over again that she is extremely unfit to be president. Trump is a proud American who deserves to run this country.
1589,"I don't trust Hillary or Trump. Hillary is sneaky, and Trump is openly evil."
1590,Gary Johnson is the best candidate. The 2 party system is ancient and rigged. Donald is a far better choice than Hillary who has been in politics for 30 years and accomplished nothing. Donald is for the people and against the system.
1591,"Trump actually seems to care about the country, and wants to do his best to improve it.  Hillary, however, only cares about her/her family's personal gain.  She doesn't care at all about the people."
1592,I feel that Hilary Clinton will win because she is more open minded. Trump has offended to many people to win. 
1593,"Trump is simply abhorrent.  One can never trust a word that comes out of his mouth.  Hillary isn't great, but she is a better option than he is."
1594,I think Donald just wants to be President to help fulfill his bucket list
1595,"Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are both awful choices. This survey didn't give me much option when it came to third parties. Donald Trump is a misogynist racist, and Hillary is a pay for play corrupt politician (see wikileaks) Although on paper my views are more in line with hers she doesn't represent my interests. I'm disabled and neither candidate gives a crap about disabled people."
1596,I want the safest one 
1597,"Hillary Clinton has many positives in her favor as she has experience and know how. Donald Trump while very charismatic, is unprepared for the responsibility of president. "
1598,NA
1599,"Donald Trump is not qualified to be President. He would just bend over for special interests. He does not care about the middle class, he's a rich person and will make life easier for the upper class. He is a puppet. His vice president is scary because he is very religious.  /  / Hillary Clinton is a candidate I would never vote for if the alternative wasn't Trump. She cooperates way too much with special interests and supports foreign policies such as aiding Saudi Arabia, the country that funded 9/11. She doesn't care about the environment and could not care less about the middle class. She is a puppet."
1600,"They're all bad, i will just vote the lesser of the evils and hope that the congress we vote for is better than in the past"
1601,"I strongly support Hillary Clinton as opposed to Donald Trump. Donald Trump doesn't have any political experience, just experience as a business man. Running a country and a business is quite different. Clinton has the experience and I agree with her views on several issues."
1602,"Regarding this election, I am very disappointed with the candidates with whom we get to choose. Clinton wants to be the first woman president -- period.  That's it. On the other hand, I would be very afraid if Trump was elected -- he is inexperienced, irrational, and has no substance at all.  Given the choice, I am probably reluctantly voting for Clinton. "
1603,"clinton is bought out by foreign governments and is even going as far to blame everything wrong on russia, which is going to lead to an inevitable war. funny considering the uranium deal. trump isn't qualified for the job but his populist movement, while risky, is a hell of a lot safer than the alternative who can't speak honestly for one day and is bankrolled by the people who have caused all the problems in the first place."
1604,"I think that Hillary Clinton is not trustworthy and only semi likeable, however I feel like she is the best choice thatwe have right now and our only hope. Secratary Clinton in very much qualified and will most likely head us in the right direction. Donald Trump is an absolutely nightmare. He is evil, he is hateful and not at all qualified to be my President."
1605,"I feel that Donald Trump is unqualified to be president, based on his lack of experience, evident lack of knowledge, and tendency toward bigotry towards minorities and women.  / I feel that Hilary's experience and record make it clear that she has the experience, as well as a nuanced understanding of issues and the ability to work with both Republicans and Democrats to achieve goals."
1606,"Both are very bad, Hillary is much worse.  I was originally a Gary Johnson fan who was let down by him"
1607,Donald Trump has never put any serious thought into any of the issues a president will have to deal with.  He'd probably chase the opinion polls and flounder around.  He'd find his power heavily constrained by the bureaucracy and the courts. /  / Hillary Clinton has a history of incompetence in leadership and far-left ideological views.  She'd be more dangerous to the country. 
1608,I'm not a supporter of Trump because of his huge ego and bigoted views. I'm also not much of a fan of Clinton because she comes across as cold at times but there's no doubt she's the better candidate of the two.
1609,"Hillary Clinton has an amazing amount of experience when it comes to the presidency. I admire her ambitions and viewpoints on nearly everything I have heard her comment about.  however, the reason I am voting for her, more than any other reason, is that Donald Trump is the anti-Christ. Not literally, but he is one of the worst narcissists I have ever seen and his dangerous and his level of stupidity and ego are dangerous. I cannot believe he has made it this far and I am ashamed to be part of a country that allows this,."
1610,"I think that Hillary Clinton is a good, if flawed, person.  She has a great deal of experience dealing with political issues and foreign policy.  Donald Trump is a strutting ass who is arrogant and ignorant.  He would be the worst president in American history by a wide margin."
1611,i support Hillary Clinton because she is honest and she cares about everyone and not just herself. Whereas Donald Trump only cares about himself and only those who are rich. 
1612,"Hillary is responsible for the death of 4 Americans and deserves to be in prison. Donald Trump albeit, it obnoxious and sexist, knows business and can get our country out of debt."
1613,"I think Trump is overbearing and doesn't have America as his best interest is merely himself and others like him. He is hyper focused on the bottom line which is money and growth. Growth for himself in the market and making business people in the upper class even wealthier. Clinton has been a face of change, be it small or large depending on the viewpoint. I don't side because of political affiliation nor do I side because of what gender the person identifies with. I look at value added ideas. "
1614,It feels as if either trump or Clinton wouldn't be what I feel were the right choices. There are other candidates and I wish others would put faith in the independent parties. 
1615,"Donald is a racist and is also very sexist. But on the other hand, Hillary is a criminal who will be impeached if elected."
1616,"I don't like either candidate and wish there was a candidate that I could trust. I will probably end up voting for the candidate that I dislike the least and that is Hillary Clinton. However, I also do not trust the electoral college so I am not sure if my vote even counts. However, it is still worth trying. "
1617,"I distrust Trump completely, he embodies everything that scares me about the current sentiment in America: xenophobia, taking advantage of others, etc.  I support Hillary because she has a lot of experience, I think she would do a good job, and it's about time we had a female president."
1618,Trump is a hateful person who is only concerned with money and helping feed his own ego. / Clinton is a genuine person who truly wishes to help this country and its citizens become better. 
1619,I am strongly for Trump. He loves America and can and will lead usin the right direction. I think Hillary is a crook and considering her past shouldn't be allowed to run at all. 
1620,"The fact that Clinton has had so much trouble if security of confidential information in her e-mails makes me think that it would be dangerous to put more confidential information relating to national security in her hands. /  / On the other side, the fact that Trump has managed the budgets and business for most of his enterprises makes me think he at least knows how to make an organization successful. /  / "
1621,"Trump is a bit wreckless but his idea is spot on. i believe that he will put a stop to much corruption that exists. I think Clinton is very dishonest and deceptive, more of the same bullshit for another 4 years. Trump is self sufficient and has no motive except to fix this screwed up mess and get us back on track. Hillary at every turn is trying to cover her mistakes."
1622,"If we were just talking issues and not character, I'd have wanted to know a lot more about Trump. Given the fact that he is sexist, racist, has sexually assaulted women and has two court hearings this month; one for raping a child, I can't look past all this and past his blow hard personality. I could look past someone's personality, but not their character. / Secretary Clinton, on the other hand, has been put under investigation, primarily by Republicans, since 1992. If she had actually done something that awful, she'd be in prison by now. Not only that, but I'm not voting for someone who's running mate believes in 'corrective therapy' for members of the GLBTQ community.  / The Secretary has spent her career defending children, even when she was forced to defend a child rapist as a public defender after requesting to be taken off the case. She did her job, even when she didn't want to. Most rapists, unfortunately, get plea deals, like her client did. That doesn't make it right; it means Secretary Clinton was put in a terrible position and STILL did what was asked of her.  / Someone doing their job in that kind of situation should be highly regarded rather than bashed and criticized so harshly.   "
1623,"I feel that Donald Trump would be a danger to the country if elected, especially in the area of foreign affairs. I feel that Hilary Clinton has made a lot of mistakes, and that this will continue to plague her if she is elected president, but I do not feel that she would do a horrible job. I am voting third party because I live in NY State and I am 100% sure the Hilary will carry the state."
1624,i don't trust clinton but she prob have the people around her to do ok. trump is too much of a wild card could be good or really awful lol
1625,"Donald Trump is a dangerous imbecile and should probably be in prison. He is a bigger threat to America than any terrorist leader. Hillary Clinton is a centrist politician and her presidency would be very normal with some advancement of Democratic policies but mostly just maintaining the status quo. The election is between a lunatic with the mind of a child, and a sane adult. "
1626,"I feel that HRC is a an experienced politician who has lied and is as corrupt as most other career politicians. Donald Trump is a bigoted, misogynistic hot head who lacks political experience and doesn't listen to his campaign advisors and very likely won't listen to his cabinet members if elected. "
1627,"The President is a puppet for the people.  It doesn't matter who is in office.  The agenda will stay the same.  Change is usually made on a more local level.  So, remember to vote in local elections as well."
1628,"Donald is a change. Bad or good we need to mix it up in Washington. A majority of politicians are career politicians and corrupt. Donald doesn't give a crap about elections, he cares about the American people. Go TRUMP!"
1629,"I believe that Donald Trump has a very narrow-minded view on the state of this country and the improvements that need to be made. I feel that his lack of political background automatically disqualifies for the job at hand. /  / While Hillary has a very extensive political background, I feel that she also has a narrow-minded view of this country and the changes that need to be made."
1630,"While I am liberal on most all social issues, I think after the economy crisis of the past decade we really need someone in office who can get our country back on track financially. Social issues are obviously important. I care deeply about social issues, but if our country is so far in debt that it cannot come back from it then social issues will be the least of our worries. Donald Trump is not always a nice person. He speaks often without thinking, but I trust he will take this country in the direction where it needs to go. "
1631,"Clinton is a very experienced candidate, and though there are many issues surrounding her and her campaign, I do not think they will impugn her ability to govern. Trump is a dumpster fire that will set the whole city ablaze given enough time."
1632,"I don't even allow Donald Trump to be in my mind because he is crass, racist, sexist and many other negative things. I hope he is roundly trounced.  I am happy we will finally have a woman president, I am not thrilled with Hillary, but I voted for her. I think she was really stupid to have that server in her house. I hope she is smarter now and will follow the rules!"
1633,"Neither of the major party candidates are attractive to me in the least.  However, Clinton is someone that I just could not vote for."
1634,"I think both are fairly bad in there own ways, both are to considered about there ego and not about improving this country. "
1635,"honestly NEITHER one would be my first choice. / HOWEVER from 2008 I Said NO way in hell would hillary make a good president..I think she could be America's Downfall.  Donald, On the other hand, is somethign Ive said for years about government... WE should run our government like a BUSINESS... and having a person with BUSINESS sense running things is a step in the right direction... FOR Starters America NEEDS to PUT america first... I think we have taken political correctness so far over the line that it is HURTING america, we need to put OUR CITIZENS needs FIRST--- NOT OTHER countries citizens.... and with trump I see less of that happening... "
1636,NA
1637,"Hillary can't be trusted and should be in jail for her emails. Trump is not the greatest guy to vote for, but he is better than Hillary. I think the voting is rigged and Hillary has already paid her way to being the president. "
1638,"Hillary Clinton is a thief and a liar. she will sell out america'a interests to the highest bidder (or donor to the Clinton foundation). she wants continue our current foreign policy, which is backwards, israel is our friend, iran is our enemy. "
1639,"I don't like Trump at all. Based on things I've heard him say in debates, interviews, twitter, etc I don't believe that he would put the country before himself. I feel like if he gets put in office it will be about what's best for him and not the country as a whole. As for Clinton there's too many things going on surrounding her for me to be fully comfortable with her running the country. "
1640,I feel that Trump is a loud irrational thinker that would lead the country to war. I feel that Clinton is more experienced with a true desire to improve the country
1641,I think that they are both 2 of the worst candidates possible. we are in a lose lose situation here. they are both pretty terrible.
1642,I think Clinton is a liar and a scam artist. I hope she ends up in prison where she belongs. Trump admits his mistakes and has the interest of the country in mind as he should.
1643,"I think Clinton is a more qualified candidate than Trump given her past experience working for the government.  While Trump has had success as a businessman, I don't think that it would wholly prepare him for office.  Some of Trumps claims have been off putting and leave me nervous to whether he can handle a position with such power."
1644,"Hillary Clinton, while flawed and not my first choice (Bernie) is still a competent politician willing to work for the people. Donald Trump is an egomaniacal blowhard who throws temper tantrums at the drop of a hat. He is a poor businessman, a scary prospect as candidates go and all around an extremely poor choice for the sort of power that the POTUS wields. "
1645,They are both the worst presidential candidates to every run for president. Hillary is only slightly less worst than Trump.   
1646,I feel like there is no real winner with this election. It is very unlikely that a third party candidate will win and both main candidates have major flaws. I would go with Hillary because Trump is too rash and radical. Hillary at least thinks her actions through before doing anything.
1647,Only voting for Hiliary because  of my dislike for trump and the values he has.
1648,"Hilary Clinton and Donald Trump are both narcissists who just want to win. Neither are right for this country, neither have the interests of the average American. "
1649,"Clinton may not be as charismatic, but she has the knowledge and skills to be successful in the role of president.  Donald Trump has no business being in public office."
1650,"I see Donald Trump as a severe liability to this country socially, economically, and internationally. I see Hillary Clinton as the least bad alternative that is currently available in this situation."
1651,"I'm not a fan of really either Clinton or Trump, but I prefer Clinton. Trump scares me as a candadite as he's very prone going off of hate. That's not how we should run our country...on fear of others."
1652,Clinton is a joke. She will end America.
1653,I think that Donal Trump is to unstable and would not trust him making major decisions.  I think Hillary Clinton has experience and would do a much better job.
1654,"Hillary Clinton isn't great, but Trump is pure evil. "
1655,I believe Trump and Hillary have little credibility and are both severely self-centered.
1656,I feel like Hillary Clinton is more likely to do good for our country.  Trump is too unpredictable and will do and say things that are going to effect our alliances with other countries which we definitely do not want.
1657,"I believe both candidates have glaring flaws. It's either a vote for incompetence or a vote for questionable establishment. In this case, I'd rather vote for the seasoned, though be it questionable, candidate."
1658,Trump has no experience and no self control. Hillary has a ton of experience and uses it to her own advantage too often.
1659,"Hilary Clinton should be in jail.  She committed an act of treason.  If she wins we will definitely go to war.  If Donald trump wins, I believe that he will increase jobs in America and that is very important for our economy right now.  He will help to fix our relations with other countries because he is the type of person who commands respect.  Nobody has respect for Clinton.  "
1660,Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump will both act in ways that are unconstitutional and will harm our great nation. Governor Gary Johnson is the only one with proven executive experience. 
1661,Hilary Clinton I myself don't think she would be a good president she's already proved that.  / Donald Trump wouldn't be the best but somewhat better in my opinion. 
1662,"I think that Hillary is a standard, run of the mill, dishonest, self-center politician. I think that Trump is a wildcard who makes off the cuff meaningless statements for attention. I hope enough people will vote third party to make a statement that our politicians are horrible and we need more honest people and different approaches."
1663,"I like the fact that Trump is an outsider, and not a politician.  Plus I like his hair. / Clinton on the other hand is a career politician, and like most politicians, she will promise to build you a bridge, even if there is no river to cross."
1664,"Trump is a moron who has no place in politics.  Hillary is kind of a crook, but she won't burn the house down.  The other two are idiots who people vote for because they want to cause drama.  "
1665,Hillary is a cunt and Donald is a perverted man child with the pigment of an Oompa Loompa 
1666,Neither one is a good choice.  I'm concerned about who they will appoint to the Supreme Court.  That is swaying my vote.  
1667,"I tried to listen carefully to Trump. His views on illegal immigration and border security piqued my interest. I can't condone his brash attitude however. He could have promised to be tough on illegal immigration without offending the illegal aliens on a personal level. He could have shown some understanding and compassion for their plight, yet still promised to send them back to where they came from. Trump is an ignorant, dangerous psychopath who can not be trusted. Clinton on the other hand comes across as a somewhat annoying schoolteacher. She seems to be quite corrupt and at the same time a real nag. Like a teacher however, she is not all bad. She at least seems to show some genuine concern for improving the conditions of those around her. Whatever scandals she's involved in seem to be fairly typical for politicians across the board and don't stand out as being excessively heinous. What worries me about Clinton is her foreign policy stance. The U.S. seems to kill a lot of people all over the world with the best of intentions. Even though the intentions are good and we proclaim to be on the side of good, we still use our military to destroy lives all over the place and overall we are the big bully on this planet, not Russia, not North Korea, not China, not Iran, but the real bully and the most evil country overall when it comes to killing people seems to be the United States. Clinton would seem to propagate this type of behavior. Johnson or Stein or even Trump to a certain extent may have taken some measures to address this issue, but I don't feel confident about any of them. So Clinton seems to be the overall best candidate."
1668,"I cannot, in good conscious, vote for Hillary Clinton knowing her position on abortion and pro-choice.  I also cannot stand by and see her voted in as President with the corruption that has surrounded her as well as her husband.  Donald Trump is the outsider.  Yes he's brash, and outspoken, but I believe he truly wants to bring about change in this country, and stop allowing the back door deals and corruption that has taken over the government.  We need to return to having jobs and creating products here in America, we need to strengthen our country instead of allowing those same jobs to be shipped overseas."
1669,I think Hilary Clinton is educated and experienced but can't really be trusted. I think Donald Trump is just a businessman who is going to look out for himself and his interests.
1670,"While I am not particularly fond of Hilary Clinton, I do believe she is the better candidate than Donald Trump.  I believe both Hilary and Donald are out of touch with the Average US Citizen, but Hilary's political experience alone makes her the better choice in my personal views."
1671,"I think Donald Trump is pretty much a morally abhorrent human being who has never demonstrated fundamental competency in pretty much any endeavor he's ever undertaken and would be an enormous liability to this country that could not possibly be over-stated. Hillary Clinton, in contrast, is a competent, high-functioning sociopath who, although completely morally protean and possessing no values of her own, can probably at least be pressured into resembling something of a functional human being during her time in office. I hate them both so very much.  "
1672,I firmly believe that Donald Trump has the country's best interest in mind. He believes in the people of this country and believes that we people are the only ones who can stop our current out of control government. Hillary Clinton on the other hand doesn't care about you or your family. All she cares about is your vote & will do anything to get it. She is only in it for herself & for her special interests. 
1673,"Neither are great candidates I want running our country for 4 years. But Trump is miles ahead of Hillary in ""bad candidate"". "
1674,I think character is the most important thing when it comes to the candidates. Neither have good character but at least Hilary seems to value immigrants and minorities.
1675,"I am repulsed by Donald Trump. He acts like a spoiled rich person. Im not really in favor of Hilary clinton winning but I would choose her over him. I think she will win the election, at least it will make history if she does. Its about time a female became president anyways . "
1676,"Donald Trump is a racist, homophobic bigot. Hillary isn't much better, but I trust her more. Trump is a very dangerous man and will lead us straight in to World War 3."
1677,I know that all  politicians are liars. I choose Hillary for reasons that I won't speak of.I know Trump knows nothing of a spec about struggling. 
1678,"Donald Trump is a racist whose whole platform is built on lies, such as bringing jobs back into the country despite him having a large percentage of his product made overseas, and his past employment of undocumented workers.  / Hilary Clinton is just as bad of a liar whose claims to represent my interests and values that I believe in, however her entire career as a politician is full of her saying one thing and then doing the exact opposite. Case in point her adopting Bernie's platform against banks and big business then in her email she states she isn't really. / I also dislike a portion of Jill Stein's policies, however they all suck and I could deal with her faults the most, even though she won't win."
1679,I am better with Trump than hillary her email scam worries me.  Trump seems to know what he is doing.
1680,"My view on Hillary Clinton is favorable because I trust in her experience in world affairs and in domestic affairs.  I know she is not perfect.  I feel that the way she handled her emails was wrong.  But I do not believe her intentions were bad.  I feel she is a very good person who honestly cares about everyone in America.  Hillary is not a racist.   I happen to like how her husband, former president Bill Clinton improved this country that can be proven with historical facts.  I have no problem with Hillary because she is a Clinton.     / Donald Trump is an unethical, immoral, racist, ignorant, small-minded, disgusting excuse for a presidential candidate.  He has offended me in many ways.  It is obvious that he uses the gift of gab to persuade and win over voters.   We all would like to believe in some of the things he is saying.  But, I am not as gullible as I used to be.    Also, many of his ACTIONS are indeed deplorable,- not the voters- but HIS ACTIONS.  I could write a thesis on all of the reasons why I have no respect for Donald Trump as a presidential candidate.  "
1681,"Neither candidate is ideal. It is a race between the lesser of two evils. Although Hillary is more qualified than Trump, she is also more corrupt than he is, and has strong ties to special interests. Trump at least speaks his mind, even if some of what he says is unpopular. Neither candidate would be a good president for America, but I feel Trump will do the least damage to our country."
1682,"The Trump train stays on message and keeps moving on even though the media keeps trying to throw dirt and mud and debris to derail Donald Trump.As far as his opponent,there is no way that the new WikiLeaks leaks or FBI investigations don't leave Hillary Clinton holding the smoking gun. The time for her departure may come next week or next month, but sooner or later, the weakened and humiliated secretary of state will have to pay at some point.As Mr.Trump has stated many times during the campaign ,""Folks what do you do with such a person""."
1683,"While admittedly not the most self educated on either candidate's supposed stances on ""key"" issues, I believe both candidates are the dregs of what could have possibly been offered.  Hillary Clinton, however, represents to me the fullest extent of how a human being can be a political machine.  Everything she says sounds pre-recorded and devoid of any honesty to the point that it is patronizing to the uppermost extreme.  I believe that anybody who believes the words she says must have the grasp of a young child.   / As for Donald Trump, I don't necessarily believe he would be an intelligent or effective president, and he's certainly got a horrible mouth on him- but in a race between two people with next to no qualities or virtues, he has his honesty and that's one more thing than Clinton has.   / It's a sad state and I really don't see a point in it."
1684,I feel like it is a losing battle whichever direction it goes.
1685,"I really do not feel positive about either candidate. I think Hillary is just a horrible dishonest person. However i also believe from a political aspect that she is the better candidate because she had much more experience. Too bad shes so very dishonest and cold-hearted. As for Mr. Trump, he has zero experience with politics and is an ass hole. I believe if he is chosen we will be put into a drastic war. "
1686,I don't trust Hillary Clinton.  I don't like the way Bengazi was handled.  I think Trump would be good for business.
1687,NA
1688,"I am a registered independent, but my viewpoints generally fall slightly left of the middle.  I do not have a truly favorable view of either candidate.  My biggest issue with Hillary Clinton is that she has always been backed by, and has supported the big banks.  She doesn't support appealing Citizens United to get money out of politics, something I believe strongly in.  But in saying that, my conscience will not allow me to vote for Donald Trump.  He is nothing more than an egotist, that has no real policy plans, just large open-ended promises.  Donald Trump would ruin this country, possible creating international tensions to which we have never seen before.  Change for the sake of change, if it isn't based on anything substantial, is dangerous.   That's what I see in people voting for Donald Trump.  Unfortunately there are no viable third party candidates as well, and will stay that way while we still have a two party system.  A vote for Hillary may be a vote for more of the same.  But a vote for Trump is a vote for catastrophe in my opinion."
1689,"Trump and Clinton have some major differences in their campaign.  Trump is trying to make America great again by removing illegals from the country therefore creating more jobs for hard working citizens.  He is also going to try to get rid of this awful Obamacare which is quite important.  Trump is upfront about his plan to go after ISIS and he doesn't seem to have any ill intentions.  This media driven hype against Trump is complete malarkey and something the media has been doing for ages to try to lean the vote toward democratic.  On the topic of Clinton, there is no doubt in my mind just by looking at her fake smile that she is not the candidate for me.  It is of great concern when someone looks like they are lying all of the time and then on top of that why is she even able to run when she is under two different federal investigations? "
1690,"The Democratic party and Hillary Clinton are leading our society in the direction of socialism.  On paper that looks great, but overall our country will lose it's capitalistic nature which we thrive on due to the lack of interest to compete when everyone is compensated the same essentially.  Donald Trump may not be a politician, but he is a business man and ultimately that is what our country is - a business where we want to make money and also have employees that are happy to work at our company and are treated well.  "
1691,"I believe Hillary Clinton is the only one qualified to handle the responsibilities in running the country.     / Donald Trump has no experience, and he was even bad at what he did before.    His policies are disastrous.  "
1692,"I don't find Clinton very credible and she is an incredibly flawed candidate but when the comparison is Trump, he's a lot worse due to the many ways he's a horrible human being, and also a poor businessman and pretty clearly a xenophobic racist."
1693,Trump hates anyone that isn't like him. Hillary  has tons of experience.
1694,"Donald Trump is a danger to our country.  Whether he wins the presidency or not, he is an incompetent, thin-skinned, fascist bully that has irrevocably changed political discourse in America for the worse. He has steepened the already existent divide that has tarnished Americans for decades between red and blue, and he has empowered radical voices on the fringe that shouldn't be legitimized in the national politics. And to have someone with no political experience making major decisions that impact our fate as a country could have catastrophic consequences both in the present and the future. /  / Hillary Clinton isn't necessarily the most perfect candidate either. Her use of emails on a private server shows that she might not be the most trustworthy person when it comes to making certain decisions. But she makes up for it with her years of experience as a Senator and Secretary of State."
1695,"Trump is an ego maniac who lacks civility and clear vision.  Hillary is corrupt, narcassistic yet has an idea how to run the country.  One is less evil than the other.  "
1696,"I was a Sanders supporter, but I'm also a life-long Democrat. Although Clinton is more militaristic and pro-corporate interest than I would like, she'll do the right thing for the country more often than not. We have no idea what policies Trump will pursue because he lies and exaggerates constantly, often conflicting with himself in previous statements. I'm more concerned about the cabinet members he will put into place and the damage they could do behind the scenes to our environment, social services, judicial system, etc. "
1697,"Donald Trump scares me. He's too full of hate. Hilary Clinton may not be the perfect person, but she's not full of hate."
1698,"I, feel that Donald Trump, would run the country better. He would build a wall and send immigrants back to their country. I, think Hillary Clinton is in it for herself.I don't believe in abortion.in which she does I, believe that people need to get out and get a job, instead she would support the poor."
1699,"Clinton seems to be a great liar, while Trump seems to be a interesting character.  I am not the fan of Clinton who is pro-abortion, while I like Trump's pro-life views.  I worry about the future, either candidate."
1700,"My views are very much like  Robert Miles.  I have no trust in Hillary Clinton and in fact believe her policies would deeply damage America.  I believe if Donald Trump is elected and pursues the policies he is advocating, government can begin to be returned to the people and start working for the people."
1701,"I believe that Hillary Clinton is a criminal and should not have been allowed to run.  I believe that Trump may not be the most upstanding person, but he is quick to apologize and he has the business sense to run this country in the next era. "
1702,"I don't agree with Clinton on just about every public position she has ever held. I believe Clinton is dishonest and has probably committed crimes. Trump occasionally blurts out a semi-reasonable, semi-sane policy, but he is so uncontrolled that one can't really know what he would do in office. On the bright side, if he had actually engaged in criminality (not just sleazy business dealings), our friends in the press would probably have uncovered that by now."
1703,I find Donald Trump the more suitable candidate.  I think Hillary is dishonest and self serving.
1704,"Hillary has flaws, but tremendous experience and intellect. I trust her completely to put together a good team to run our country for the next 4 years. / I do not trust Trump's experience, intellect or intentions. I believe he's only in this for himself and would make a horrible president. One has to be cool, calm and collected to lead this great nation, and I don't think he has that ability. "
1705,"Honestly I think this election is a joke and both major party candidates are really bad. Trump is a misogynist and a corrupt businessman and Clinton is only worse than him because she is an actual criminal and wants to start a war. I voted for third party candidate Jill Stein, the only legitimate seeming presidential candidate."
1706,"I think Ms. Clinton is a competent, compassionate person and a good choice for president. I think Mr. Trump has already caused enough trouble in our country already, and I don't want him in charge of any weapons."
1707,hillary is not trump.  'nuff said
1708,NA
1709,"Hillary is experienced, informed, smarter than most politicians and likely in it as much for herself as she is for the American people. While I don't think we will see a huge change with her as President unless Sanders is able to influence her greatly, I do think she will do at least a decent job - and that she is well equipped to do the job. /  / Trump, on the other hand, is a misogynistic, racist, homophobic, megalomaniac, hate-mongering, ignorant ass who will take this country down. I do believe he is diagnosable - some sort of mental illness - and one of the most astounding liars I've ever had the displeasure of witnessing. He will destroy this country."
1710,"I think Trump has no policy knowledge or plans. He is a reality star making a fool out of the system. Hillary is very untrustworthy with her scandals. But she is experienced and can't be as bad as Trump. All in all, the worst 2 candidates I have seen in my life."
1711,"I think Trump is an egomaniac who only believes in getting more for himself and doesn't really care about the middle or lower class. Hillary may be flawed, but she's experienced in politics and knows how to do the job of President."
1712,"I don't really favor either of the candidates. A lot of the stuff Trump says is just crazy and thinking he could be our next president scares me. I do take into consideration that he expresses his opinions openly and doesn't try to hide anything. I'm not too much involved in politics but Hillary seems more fit to be our next President. I have watched all three debates and she is more composed and talks directly to the people. She also answers the questions rather than trying to go around it. Overall, I favor Hillary a little bit more than Trump."
1713,I think Hilary is a great candidate for president she seems to be a problem solver. I have always respected Donald Trump and probably would also make a very good president. His derogatory words don't seem to match his benevolent actions.
1714,"donald trum is the worst candidate in the history if presidential elections.Hillary Clinton past is really murky, but she is the least worst of the all"
1715,I do not favor either Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton they are in the race for power.  I cannot be a part of their corruption and if I go ahead and vote for them I am supporting corrupt leaders. 
1716,NA
1717,"I believe that no politician is 100% honorable and this election is no different.  Trump is a dangerous choice.  I don't believe he's in it for the good the US.  I think his running is an ego trip for him.  I like Hilary, I like what she stands for and I'm with her :)"
1718,"Clinton will fight for the middle class in some regards, so Robert was somewhat correct there. I also agree with Robert that Trump will attempt to run this country like a business, and that is a scary thought. Hillary is far from perfect, but she is the obvious choice for the lesser of two evils."
1719,NA
