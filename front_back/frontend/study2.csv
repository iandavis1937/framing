438,Trump is a fascist and a danger to the country. Clinton is neither of those things. The other candidates are unqualified.
439,NA
440,"i think both candidates have made mistakes, but donald trump is far worse than clinton"
441,Both are terrible candidates for different reasons. I voted early and did not vote for either of them. The 2 party system is ridiculous and undemocratic.
442,Trump is not just wrong. He is unstable and colloquially I could say crazy.  Hillary is intelligent if flawed but the better leader.
443,I Think both are very deeply flawed and think both will have issues as president. I Think Clinton has a bad history of lying and while I do not agree with most of Trump he does tell the truth. I think this is a scary election.
