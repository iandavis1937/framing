"22514961526","I don't really have an opinion as I don't know what our opinions would matter and cause."
"22036229348","Reflecting on that conversation, my opinion on immigration policy hasn’t changed, but I’ve gained a deeper understanding of why people prioritize security and economic stability in the debate. I still believe that a more inclusive and humane approach is essential, not only for moral reasons but because immigrants contribute significantly to the economy and society. However, I now recognize that some people feel genuine fear about national security and job competition, and that fear drives their stance on stricter regulations.

This understanding has made me realize that, to move forward, we need to balance compassion with security. Solutions should address both concerns, ensuring that we protect borders while also treating people fairly and acknowledging their potential to enrich our country. So, while my stance remains largely the same, I now see the importance of incorporating these concerns into the discussion to find common ground."
"22840976764","After last night, even harder that Trump and his cult need to be stopped."
"22817554916","My opinion now is way more elaborated but still in the same position just a little more informed "
"22518596833","I still have the same opinion about the former president and the current election. I think that there is a clear line in the sand, and unfortunately, there will be backlash no matter who wins"
"22913079630","The same exact opinion. I still dislike and do not support Trump. I still support Harris. "
"848685437","I feel like those who support Donald Trump are misinformed about his past as well as what he is going to do for the country. I'm heavily against voting for him as president knowing his track record. People on both sides are influenced by propaganda, but Donald Trump supporters are moreso influenced because they follow him like obedient dogs. No matter what he does, no matter how worse America has been since he's been in power, they follow. I wish these people also didn't call us ""liberals"" as if it's a derogatory term. I wish they would be more kind and understanding instead of being steadfast on Trump issues. "
"22972258816","I still hold the same opinions about gun control as I did prior to the conversation. This other person thinks guns should be completely banned, but I think people have the right to a firearm (only things like handguns, I don't think any kind of assault weapon is acceptable) under specific circumstances (like not being a felon, being mentally stable, etc.)."
"22194299874","My opinion now of the issue we discussed is more open, as I was encouraged to think of different scenarios that would arise. I understand the need for some action on the matter, but not complete control, as they were for."
"22767147932","I am able to think more about his perspective and the perspective of many others who hold similar views in the sense that I can understand and empathize more with where they are coming from!"
"343169334","Kamala Harris is the most logical person to vote for during the election. First off how could we shout equal rights and make America great with a felon running for president."
"174565034","I really hope Donald Trump wins and brings back the Republicans in office. Greg Abbott did alot for Texans in his time for office and I believe that having Trump in office just like in 2016 would change alot of things. There was actual tariffs which punished companies bringing cheap ""communist"" products and actual cheap gas."
"22296817531","We discussed whether we thought Trump or Harris would win as well as their presentation since the Harris campaign kicked off. Before the conversation I believed Harris was on track for a victory and that Trump has always had terrible credibility and a vulgar presentation. I still believe the same, except now I believe that there are people who are using misogyny to justify their preference for Trump. The person I spoke to pointed out that ""Harris laughs too much"". This statement is something I have heard from conservation reporters on the news and social media and it leads me to believe the person I spoke to already watched conservative media and supports Donald Trump, but doesn't want to be attacked for liking Trump. So, they choose to say their preference for Trump comes from believing Harris is unfit rather than admitting they are Trump supporters."
"22099477392","I am happy we had that conversation"
"22923109527","It is the same as before. Nothing changed."
"22807837864","I'm not surprised, but at the same time still surprised with the encounter. The person who I held the conversation with, my mom, is someone who is constantly affected by propaganda and misinformation on the internet. I wasn't surprised she shut down the conversation quickly, because I have previously expressed distaste with her political choices. Her reasoning being ""I hate Biden"" there was no other reason, with the exception of her issue with ""illegal immigrants"" despite her herself being an immigrant from a communist country. It's very confusing to me and I feel as though it's just something I can't discuss with her with the new conversation I had. "
"22686838170","I am okay with gun ownership in America as long as restrictions (ideally bans) are place on assault style weapons."
"22405321410","My opinions haven't changed, I think that my ideas are supported by facts and evidence and the people who attempt to dissuade me frankly have no idea how to discern fact from fiction"
"22757378832","I still stand in the same position because I am a person of science. It is not a religion or a belief, but a fact. "
"980688019","ㅤ"
"22218463600","It's still the same. I don't know how my view would have changed after a couple of questions"
"22210794301","Yeah didn't change my views at all, maybe even making them stronger."
"22477447196","I think the way to have an in-person conversation like I had done it was the best way to go.  No one is perfect but people can take a stance with however they feel justified."
"22469320509","Reflecting on my conversation with Alex about climate change policy, I still firmly believe in the need for strong government action to address the issue. I’m convinced that stricter regulations on carbon emissions and a robust push towards renewable energy are crucial steps in tackling climate change effectively. The environmental benefits are clear, and I’m also persuaded that transitioning to a greener economy has the potential to create numerous job opportunities in new industries.

However, I’ve gained a deeper appreciation for Alex’s concerns about the economic impact of such regulations. The potential costs and the effect on industries reliant on fossil fuels are valid points that deserve serious consideration. I now see that incorporating market-based solutions and fostering technological innovation could complement regulatory efforts and help mitigate economic disruptions.

Overall, while I still support aggressive climate action, I recognize that a balanced approach that addresses both environmental and economic concerns might be more effective. The conversation with Alex reinforced the importance of continuing these discussions to explore how we can achieve our climate goals in a way that benefits everyone."
"22256771159","Less an issue than the state of political divide, for the first time I am seeing a broad unity among my peers around a presidential candidate who seems to support the younger demographics outspokenly. My budding opinion that Kamala Harris seems to have the most persuasive arguments for someone of my age and status was confirmed by the popularity of her ideals amongst my peers."
"22376307028","I didn't find my own opinion changing much, but I did feel that I was able to have a small impact on my aunt and uncle in terms of helping them to see differing viewpoints from someone in their life whom they care about and share identities with."
"22908486580","My opinion remains the same. "
"22718758808","I still agree.  Right now, with the election, most people I know have their minds made up and do not want to hear anything positive about the other side.  "
"641171703","I'm unsure if this is truly political, but the discussion was on parenting, and the rights of both parent and child. My opinion is the same as it was before, that for a parent to hit a child, for any reason, is abuse. In any other instance, against any other person, against an animal, its assault and quite possibly abuse; why does a child, scarred and lone, have less rights and protections than a dog? Follow up, why does a parent, who would face legal action if they ever raised a hand to a spouse, get to discipline someone in their care however they see fit? A child shouldn't and a parent shouldn't, that is my opinion."
"110153238","We both ended up at a more ""realistic"" perspective of the issue in gun control, that is, that the answer to the issue that would actually address the root cause would involve an overly complex solution that also dibbles on other problems such as poverty, crime, the mental health crisis, and so on, to be properly addressed."
"22493330088","I still think that the information presented now about the politician's corruption is unveiling and revealing. Therefore, if my friend still supports the politician, they must convince the politician to do what is right, return the funds, own the mistakes, and sincerely serve the public well. Sadly, the supporters continue to find blame on other people, boosting the corrupt politician's narcissism and ""victim"" image. I wish my friends could let go of their bias toward politicians to see the side of the general public good. "
"22287370600","We talked about the upcoming election. We simply shared our views on what we thought was going to happen and what kinds of effects each candidate would have on the country. I stated that I think Trump would have a positive impact on the economy, while with Harris in office, it might be rather stagnant. Also, I think that Trump will have a stricter immigration policy, while Harris probably won't make much of an effort to close the border."
"22633910164","My opinion is that there should be stricter gun control. I don't think it should be possible for an 18 year old to walk into a gun shop and walk out with an AK-47 with no training, supervision, or vetting. The process to get a drivers license requires weeks of training, a knowledge exam AND a road test in order to ensure safety of those on the road. Why isn't there any precautions or requirements for someone buying a lethal weapon."
"22142641696","They only spoke in click bait jargon, using all the buzz words. They did not want to hear anything different they their own beliefs and could not understand any other side. "
"22095228162","We spoke about the abortion issue. I think that supporting a woman’s right to choose is about trusting individuals to make the best decisions for their own bodies and lives. Roe v. Wade protected that right by giving women the freedom to decide if and when to have a child, especially in tough situations like health risks or unwanted pregnancies. It ensured that these decisions could be made safely, with access to proper medical care, instead of pushing women into dangerous, illegal procedures. Everyone's circumstances are different, and Roe v. Wade respected that by letting women make personal choices without government interference."
"22591418090","My political views are still the same, as none of us really wanted to turn the conversation into something too serious. It was mainly just for amusement."
"22112259011","My opinion hasn't changed. Taxes should target the billionaires and not the middle class."
"22187319598","My opinion on gun control is that there should be safeguards put into place while also not limiting someones right to own a firearm. While there have been horrible things done by bad people using guns, I don't think that should mean that everyone should lose access to something that they use for a hobby, collect, or simply want to own for their safety. Mental health is usually the real issue when it comes to mass shootings or killings with guns, so I think that background checks and/or mental health checks should be mandatory when purchasing a gun. Maybe not every single time, but there should be more than there is now. People don't deserve to lose their rights because of bad mentally unwell people. "
"22058345451","My opinion now has strengthened my initial belief that everyone has the responsibility to vote."
"22960302155","Unchanged, because I didn't get to have a meaningful conversation. I was just yelled at and treated like the enemy."
"157213687","Reflecting on the recent conversation about politics, I find that my opinion has become more nuanced. While I still hold my core beliefs, the discussion helped me understand that the other side often comes from a place of genuine concern, even if the values or priorities differ from mine. It’s clear that the polarization we face isn’t solely due to individuals but is also influenced by media and political rhetoric. I now feel that addressing these divisions requires more open dialogue and less reliance on generalizations about the “other side.” Understanding each other’s concerns might be the first step in bridging the gap."
"22446825012","My opinion is unchanged. I didn't think it was worth alerting the person to my differing opinion and risking them getting riled up, and I was bored of hearing the same basic opinion of a person clearly influenced by watching left-leaning news every day."
"22142624065","I still believe that Muslims are not extremists within their religion and that they don't all believe in a Holy War against all other religions.  I do understand that there are extremists within the religion, but every religion has extremists.  The religion may be more predisposed to it through its views and teachings, but those teachings seem to be misunderstood by those extremists."
"27832616326","My opinion has not changed because I do not care about the issue."
"406239827","I am sticked with my old statement that Trump will be the new president. Because of the public mentality, Trump will be ahead of Harris."
"22129717453","Very respectful however neither of our views changed. We were both set in our ways."
"25122772452","I still am extremley pro-choice. I believe if a woman does not want to get one then that is okay, but if a woman does want to- I believe she has a right to the choice. My conversation changed nothing. "
"22426061492","I still have the same opinion. The other side was not able to persuade me to dislike Trump. I understand both candidates have their wrongs, that's part of the natural man. However, I think that Trump is more fit to be in office."
"22314889101","I believe I still have the same view on abortion. I have this belief and technically someone can't argue with what you as a person believes in. On the political and legal side I somewhat understand the opposing sides view. "
"22210129367","After some reflection, I still retain my initial opinion of the issue. However, the conversation helped me understand why someone would support the other side of the argument. As a result, I was able to hold a more informed opinion that is based more on facts rather than bias."
"22241482605","i don't feel comfortable sharing my opinion"
"22389086610","Kamala dumb dumb!"
"22779498622","My opinion of the issue has not changed since I have not been presented with any information that would change it. "
"29729788140","This is more of a moral and religious issue for me, so I will always stand on pro-life. Yes, there are circumstances where abortion can be justified, but a life is still a life. "
"876261919","i believe donald trump should be president"
"25330009695","
Reflecting on my previous conversation about Donald Trump’s presidency, I still believe that understanding multiple perspectives is crucial for healthy political discourse. While I disagree with the notion that Trump was the greatest president since Lincoln, I do see why some people feel strongly about his policies on jobs, immigration, and his outsider status in Washington. However, I remain concerned about the divisiveness of his rhetoric and the long-term impact of his policies on marginalized communities and democratic norms. My opinion hasn't changed much."
"22406636212","I think is just the different opinions about both candidates"
"22457717837"," I still believe that stronger border enforcement is important for maintaining security and order, but I’ve also grown to understand the humanitarian considerations my friend emphasized. The idea that people fleeing violence or economic hardship deserve compassion and a chance at a better life resonates with me more now. I think a balanced approach is necessary—one that ensures legal processes are efficient and fair while maintaining the security of the country. The conversation highlighted that neither side has all the answers, and the best solutions likely lie in compromise and thoughtful reform."
"22618398083","The immigration issue, most of my views stay the same, but I do understand where anti immigration comes from. "
"151313816","My opinion of immigration is it should be more supported as there should be an easier process to be allowed to legally immigrate to the country as the long and lengthy legal process is what causes a majority of people to go into the illegal route"
"22043600672","Unsure of which issue"
"22919128222","I did not speak with someone whose views were completely different than mine. Our views are more similar than different. We agree on a lot of different topics and they were more informed than me on many topics, and I read different articles they sent me to learn more about that topic. "
"25289616758","We discussed the US economy and how it has been destroyed over the past few years. My opinion about it didn't really change but the opinion of the person I talked to did change some. "
"28109646793","It was just something they said during the campaign."
"22048765934","I talked about inflation and the economy. trump is not even successful in his own businesses and I provided facts but the person who I was talking to started bringing in religion and info from facebook! I do not enjoy talking to incompetent people. My opinion is the same. "
"22973731918","I think my opinions still stay the same, I believe she has some truth to her statements and I respect her opinions."
"22508248130","Women's Rights 
I feel as if a woman should have the right to choose what to do with her body"
"22247938747","After reflecting on the conversation, I still support expanding universal healthcare, but I now have a deeper understanding of the concerns surrounding government inefficiency and taxation. While I believe that healthcare should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their financial situation, I can see why people like Tom are wary of increased government control and the potential economic impact. His point about keeping costs down and ensuring efficiency made me think more critically about how such a system could be designed. While I haven’t changed my stance, I’m more aware of the complexities involved and recognize that finding a middle ground—such as balancing public and private healthcare options—could be a more realistic and effective approach."
"22311668148","The exact same as before, but at least I have a better understanding of the opposing view. That said, I do feel the other view was even less substantiated than I thought; so while conversation does help, I feel in a certain way I respect their opinion a little bit less after talking. "
"126082027","I discussed climate change with a friend. They were concerned about the impacts certain policies could have on the economy, such as costs and job losses. I agreed with these concerned. I argued that I believe the environment was top priority because the economy wouldn't matter if there wasn't a habitable place for people to live and use the economy. However, I also understood the importance of protecting or helping those with jobs and trying to keep costs low if possible. I said I believe both sides had valid arguments and should work together instead of against each other."
"22066676445","I can see how many aren't really persuaded by new information. Once opinions are made of candidates, most people will stand by them regardless of new information. It is important to be understanding but open to change and open minded to prevent falling into those pitfalls. "
"22378501726","my body is my body as a women what i chose to do with it is nobody choice"
"22295874297","I honestly can’t understand why people are opposed to the environmental movement or fighting climate change and stuff like that. The only argument I’m aware of against it is that it’s a hoax/lie, but simply going outside or reading the news will tell you that it’s a real thing!!! So crazy to me"
"500257932","I think that I am still very pro-life and will vote for Trump. My ideas are based on facts, while hers are based more on emotion. She believes that it is the women's choice of what to do with her body, but I told her that the women is choosing what to do with another body, not her own. Conception is when life is formed and if you get an abortion at any stage, you are killing a living being. "
"22110663780","I'm more open to listening and understanding the other side"
"28751677725","My opinion has remained the same. Most of the time when arguing politics with people, they're very uninformed (as we all should be honestly, the median American doesn't have time to think about politics). People strongly believe what they want, and aren't gonna change their mind unless they already intend on doing so or are more open minded. I still think immigration as a concept is not inherintly a bad thing, and is demonized by firs the conservative party, but then by Joe Biden in 2020 calling it a problem, when historically democrats viewed it as a benefit to the country."
"390929751","Everything went well."
"22549442081","I supported Harris in the debate, and we talked about how Taylor swift endorsed harris despite her carbon footprint. I believe in sustainability and rightful consumption."
"22162787616","My opinion on the discussed issue has not changed because I am not easily influenced by others without facts or an explanation."
"22893191951","I have the same opinion as before
"
"493460346","I still hold my ground with the same opinions. I think it was a well-worded conversation, but in the end I don't think either of us will budge on our stances."
"22916108432","I discussed that the moderators were extremely biased and asked terrible questions, and ganged up on Trump. I also discussed that neither candidate performed well enough to change the outcome of the election. "
"22814290852","I appreciate that I can have a civil conversation with peers that does not result in attacking the other candidate."
"704289048","I have the same opinions as I did before the conversation. I strongly believe in the issue discussed. I can understand where he was coming from with his arguments but some things were not very factual. "
"22598435407","I do not like talking with Liberals because they simple do not listen. It is annoying they always think they are right and can not listen to another opinion. They also have celebrities telling them to vote the wrong way."
"22844854900","My opinion is exactly the same. In fact, I had forgotten of that conversation until it was brought up in this survey. So the conversation did not have a big impact on my life."
"22740923844","My opinion has not changed. This was simply sharing of opinions, and nothing put forth convinced me to change my opinion."
"306290709","I believe the borders should be secure and regulated much better than they are currently."
"22989616210","We discussed many things such as climate change and Kamala Harris. I did and still do beleive climate change is a big issue and it is one of the few topics I am more on the liberal side of so it was easy to find common ground. We also discussed Kamala as I argued that many of her policies are just words as she has had opportunities as VP to get some of these objectives completed. My counterpart argued thats not how it works. "
"22764629085","My opinion on the issue did not change, but I do understand why someone would think differently than me. "
"22952095922","The influence of political propaganda is not only targeted towards one specific audience or political faction, but to influence everyone of all ideological thought processes. "
"22801230299","My views haven't really changed. Excluding extremist approaches, I can confidently say I would vote for whichever candidate best represents my beliefs."
"445512198","I went in to the conversation open to learning about my friend's perspective. I wanted to know why they were adamant in their position, when I felt so strongly about my own. After the issue was discussed however, I can understand why some people feel safer by having access to guns. This doesn't change my opinion or feeling that guns are more likely to cause more trouble than good. But I am more open to the idea that some people could responsibly and safely have guns in their home."
"22209131266","My opinion has stayed the same after my conversation. I think Kamala Harris is the right candidate for president, mostly because the alternative option is to have Donald Trump become president again. I believe that people who vote for Trump are usually misinformed, led by propaganda. Trump voters refuse to recognize the damage caused by his presidency, and refuse to see how our country was viewed by other countries with Trump elected as our leader. "
"857341042","Regarding abortion, my opinion has not changed significantly enough for a complete turnaround in my stance of being Pro-Choice. Although my discussion with OJ was meaningful in that I was able to accept the reasoning behind a differing viewpoint, I still am convinced not to abandon the logic behind my position. Yes, OJ and I came to the agreement that under special circumstances an abortion was necessary, but I still feel that families should have the liberty and right to decide if an abortion is best for their situation. "
"22394715874","I still stand very much liberal and think trump is a nincompoop.  "
"22540545880","I still believe in what I did that all women should have the right to decide. Because when a child is born and that woman is unable to take care of the child it goes into foster care which is already a huge mess. Rather than put a child through all that why not let the woman decide when she wants to have a child and if she does at all. Not only that women who are forced to carry children of their assaulters and rapist it is a traumatic event. Other women also undergo complications with their pregnancy that can put their and the child's life at risk."
"22117041166","My opinion is unchanged. After reading the more extreme position of the person who's opinion I responded to, however, I definitely appreciate the civility and perspective of the person I talked to."
"22888969148","I still stick to my opinion of Donald Trump and will not be swayed, even if he has a few points that I agree with."
"22537419710","I still slightly support Trump. I am not influenced by that student because what he said is too subjective."
"22061335859","That both sides are searching for a more professional candidate to lead our country and not just someone who can out pay others to get to their current position. "
"22100122644","I still don't think I'll side with either or since they both don't seem fit enough for me, but if I absolutely had to side with someone I will with Trump. This is now my opinion because I see that every person who is voting for Kamala is so misinformed and just wants to vote for her because they hate Trump because he says contriversal things. Regardless of what he says, he's actions are more important, and he did good in his past presidency. Kamala didn't do much in her vice presidency so I don't support her.  "
"22856275459","My opinion didn't change at all. I still think that gun are like alcohol, If you ban them then the people that really care to have them (the people using them for wrong) will just be sneaky and get them anyways. "
"22700963093","My opinion still stands on the issue we discussed. I tried to hear the other person out and look at the stance from their perspective. But, they were very stubborn and would not hear me out. This made me lose respect for the other person and not take them as seriously. "
"27315583011",""
"22197390322","My opinions did not change after we had this discussion. Part of this is probably because of the check-in we did at the beginning. We understood that we were trying to get the other one to switch, just to try and understand each other better. "
"22515872515","I believe that the people I talked to are slightly brain washed and make everything Trump says sound amazing, and they hate liberals. I know they feel like that and they are afraid to speak about it because they don't know how to back up their logic."
"22384118271","I feel roughly the same. There has not been a big swing in either direction for my opinions. "
"558467284","I think i'm right "
"22344240674","I think both candidates for the presidency are bad and that the only somewhat good one dropped out to indorse Trump."
"22337115974","My opinion remains the same, but I understand where the other side comes from. They didn't realize the impacts and alternatives to abortion, as well as the importance of sexual education. I now know that many people who are strongly opinionated on abortion may not realize that it is not as simple as pro-life or pro-choice."
"22581441132","My opinion is still the same, it was about the Texas border and illegal immigration, it needs to be taken care of with any force necessary. US Citizens should be the only priority for the US."
"22169395352","My stance has not changed as I still support not only a woman's right to choose but that the government should not get in the way of conversations between the pregnant person and their doctor."
"22071506930","Honestly I still need to look into what is correct, as the topic is grounded in facts. "
"22993864500","My opinion is unchanged, but I can understand the personal experiences that may shape other people’s opinions and understandings. "
"22351496099","I am still pro-choice"
"22324331913","my opinions are the same"
"22131016557","My opinions on the issue we discussed have not changed. My mind is generally made up by facts and logically thinking through something, and the other side of this issue is much more influenced by emotions. There's nothing wrong with being an empathetic person, but that's much less likely to get me to change my opinions."
"22057336071","I think we need immigration and should make it slightly easier for people to come into our country so they don't feel the need to be illegals. Although we should have stronger laws on what happens if contraband is brought in though. "
"22239151109","We discussed the issue of the two-party political system in the US. I believe that it's flawed, yes, but it does a reasonable job of representing the will of the people, as opposed to multiple smaller political parties, which necessarily represent the will of a smaller percentage of the people."
"22292178670","My opinion was simply that we have to look at the pros and cons of what the candidates will do for the country, not how they act."
"26565242338","I still think I am lightly a moderate but I am able to see the other side."
"418266651","My opinion now has not varied that much, like I mentioned in my previous answer. I believe that we both had points where we both lacked knowledge in regards to certain policies, or couldn't specifically point to a legislative procedure/fact to prove our claims."

The only real change in my position is establishing that they get slightly lower priority."

Like, both candidates are clearly, clearly imperfect; what's the point in choosing one over the other? Of course, it depends on your perspective. Still, looking closely myself, I have found that voting for Trump may lead to more unfavorable outcomes for federal law compared to Kamala, which is why I still prefer Kamala."

I think abortion should still be legal, safe, and rare. In cases of rape, incest, other assault, to save the mothers life, etc., abortion should be legal in every state. People should not be getting abortions after the 1st trimester, even after the heartbeat of the fetus. Late-term abortions don't make sense to me. You knew you were pregnant for several months and at the end of the pregnancy, when you could give the child up for adoption, you choose to abort? Most late-term abortions aren't to save the mothers' life, but for convenience, and I think that is wrong. 
I am completely against illegal immigration. We can't let people into our country that we don't know anything about. It's a national security issue. They could bring crime, violence, terrorism, drugs with them. We have a legal process to enter the country. Follow the rules."

The border issue affects the rest of the issues at hand. It is hurting our economy by illegal immigrants taking jobs and government funding. It is causing safety issues where illegal immigrants are killing and raping innocent citizens. It's also hurting the drug problem in America where people are dying because of the illegal drugs being sent through the border. It is still a major issue that needs to be fixed, or our country will have some major problems."

While I still prioritize fiscal responsibility to avoid excessive national debt and economic instability, I now see more clearly the moral and social imperatives that my counterpart was championing. This has led me to consider the balance between prudent financial management and necessary investment in social infrastructure more thoughtfully.

"22918638245","My opinion now is that it’s crucial to weigh all perspectives carefully. While strong opinions and emotional reactions are common, taking a step back to consider different viewpoints can provide a clearer understanding of the issues. Everyone brings their own experiences and biases to the table, and acknowledging this can help with having more civil conversations. For example, the person who supported Trump in his argument seemed to care about the small ""good"" that Trump had done amidst all his issues. Perhaps they do care for the general public, and they are just misinformed. This is not always a fault of their own, as they could have been affected by those around them or propaganda they see online. "

The digital medium and hiding behind a screen don't help, but physically talking with a person face to face you are far more likely to find something you agree on rather than disagree. And that's what we need to do, as friends, as neighbors, as family, is find middle ground to support each other. As I said in that response, I think it is highly unlikely you could find anyone in the U.S. who actively wants our country to be worse.

An abortion could save the mothers life. "
"22317682005","I find it more valuable to discuss the issues candidates are standing for rather than discussing the candidates themselves. You are often not going to change people's minds about the candidates when throwing out a bunch of rageful statements about the opposing candidate, but if you are able to change someone's mind about the issues they fighting and voting for, perhaps that will lead to a switch in who they are ultimately voting for in the end."

"
"22414501950","In my view, the pro-life stance is centered on the belief that life begins at conception, and that every unborn child has the right to life. Advocates of this perspective argue that abortion ends a human life and that society has a responsibility to protect the most vulnerable. Many believe there are ethical alternatives, such as adoption, that respect both the life of the child and the rights of the mother. From this viewpoint, life should be valued and defended at all stages, and the sanctity of life should take precedence over personal choice. While the issue is complex, pro-life supporters emphasize the moral obligation to protect life from the moment of conception."

I support the right to bear arms, but I believe there should be regulations put in place to limit the types of weapons Americans have access to, who can have them (not criminals, minors, etc.), limit where they can be taken (not areas such as schools, public parks, etc.) and that it should be required for individuals to take training courses and utilize proper storage/carrying practices. My opinion did not change because the discussion did not bring up any new information or points I had not considered before. Additionally, the person I had the discussion with was very close minded about the issue and refused to hear any opinion except one that supported their own. I find it difficult to reconsider my opinion on an issue if the person I am discussing it with cannot provide any explanation or supporting reason to why it is “wrong” other than statements such as “guns are murder machines” and “guns are bad.” "

If a kid was trying to commit suicide for another reason like not being allowed to smoke drugs, the answer wouldn't be to give them more drugs so they wouldn't want to kill themselves, it would to help them in more personal ways by teaching them the harmful effects of drugs at an early age."

I believe that bringing people into our country who seek a better life and want to get their status the right way should be welcomed, but it is hard to make sure those who want to cheat the system are held accountable."

"22663361612","My opinion on the issue we discussed didn't really change since he didn't seem to know much about it. He did say that we should just have normal rectangle-shaped districts, which I disagreed with him on because I pointed out that sometimes districts would be forced to look a little weird to keep population numbers equal. I think this was an issue he didn't have strong feelings or much knowledge about while I did, so the opinion changing was pretty one-sided."

"22622677352","The issues we discussed were mostly economics and abortion. They started by saying they were pro-life but after I explained my argument for pro-choice they changed their views. They stated that Trump did way better for the economy than Biden but had no stats to back it up and I said I'm not so sure but also didn't have any stats on hand so it was kind of unproductive."

"22741000741","I believe America should remain involved in Peacekeeping missions and global issues abroad. I say this because with the rise of dictators like Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin exerting themselves over neighboring nations, they have been able to expand their influence through alliances like the CSTO and BRICS to cripple us. As such, we need to continue to support our allies and bolster forces such as Ukraine and Taiwan to help deter these dictators from any irrational moves. I also believe that we should continue our peacekeeping missions for the same reason, which is to maintain international law in nations where it has collapsed. While I do think this should be strictly voluntary, it is our obligation as the most militarized power on earth to enforce international law in nations that are in dire need of help from atrocities."
"22628605023","I feel that America is not ""the worst it's ever been."" Lots of messaging from the right wants voters to believe that America is in a state of Anarchy with the current administration, but thats simply not the case. Sure, there are many issues in America currently, but America still has one of if not the best standards of living in the world in my opinion. I'd argue that the Civil War, Great Depression, and WW2 were much harder on the majority of Americans than current issues.  "
"22314765458","I feel the same about the issues. I was not provided any compelling accounts that would make me change the way I think about these things. I can understand how it happens better and see the way these ideas formed (to be clear, I don't think people who feel differently are unreasonable monsters. Their ideological underpinnings and sources of information are clear), but that provided no reason to change my views. I don't think reality lies in the center just because people feel differently."

"22163641733","I don’t believe it’s viable to completely close the borders or attempt to deport millions of immigrants. These proposals also conflict with my values.

"22483082522","Exactly the same"
"22814405948","My opinion stayed the same. While I do think there are better candidates than Kamala as she does have some issues, I don't think we nearly have as much support for the Green Party as we wish. Many of them are not popular, don't have media presence, and therefore a good section of our country probably wouldn't even know they are running until ballot day."
"22511000231","A complete waste of time. Anything remotely anti-Trump is suspect, so criticism is forbidden and set aside any time it is mentioned."
"22176714644","I still have the same opinion. I think abortion is a fundamental right for all women. I think there should probably be restrictions on when you can have an abortion, but I think its preposterous to say that women shouldn't have the choice on what they want to do with their body, especially if it jeopardizes their own health."
"22930536161","The border definitely has problems as many people are immigrating here illegally, but I think there is a bigger problem to focus on. If we focused on making the legal way of immigrating to the US easier and a shorter process we would have less of an issue. I also think the border needs to be protected more to stop illegal drugs from crossing the border."

"22060892512","Reflecting on the recent debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, which was characterized by fiery exchanges and pointed accusations, it feels like the conversation highlighted deep divisions on key political issues such as the January 6th Capitol attack and immigration. Both sides made aggressive claims, often invoking exaggerated or misleading information, which intensified partisan divides rather than fostering constructive dialogue. This debate, much like many political discussions, seemed more focused on rallying their bases rather than genuinely addressing complex issues or finding common ground​


In my own discussions with people holding opposing views, I find myself increasingly concerned with how polarized these debates have become. Rather than seeing people as engaging in a shared problem-solving process, it's more about scoring points or reinforcing pre-existing beliefs. This only deepens the disconnect between political factions, making compromise and understanding more elusive."
"22284621474","My opinion on the issue of abortion is pro choice. Personally, my ideologies line up with letting the woman make the decision of abortion, rather than completely outlawing it. Although I am pro-choice, I fully understand why some people are pro-life."

"954406579","The economy is fleeting and there will always be periods of depression, inflation, etc. 
They will occur whether a conservative, a liberal, or an independent president/cabinet is in office.

However, generally speaking, I tend to think conservatives lean towards worsening the economy due to their policies and acts, which favor rich people and screw the working class/middle class, and they end up the ones who have to foot the bill.

"22660941945","I feel that TERFS have done some very unacceptable things, and that in many ways they qualify as a hate group. That being said, I can see where a lot of their hatred is coming from, and how it originates in fear. I think that to truly solve the issue, both sides need to acknowledge each others' fears, and learn that they don't have as many differences as they think. I fully do not support any sort of hatred towards trans people, and I fully condemn what TERFS do and stand for, but their fears should be addressed, not just ignored. "

However, speaking with people that opposed this belief of mind have opened my mind to their sentiments and beliefs. And though it scares me that this right maybe overturned, it gives me hope that people are starting to relax on this reservations.

Many of those I spoke to have said they are open to civil marriages or contractual bonds, but the religious aspects of marriage is still strongly held."
"22893033288","My opinion's unchanged. I think abortion is a very tricky topic, but forcing people to carry pregnancies to term that they don't want is highly immoral. We'd all like abortion to not be needed. It can be expensive, invasive, embarrassing, and sometimes even traumatizing. And yet, pregnant individuals deserve options, especially in the case of rape, incest, fatal issues for the child, health issues for the mother, etc. The choice to abort is between a patient and their healthcare team--not politicians. 

Besides, if people /actually/ wanted to reduce abortions, they'd have real comprehensive sex education in schools, not the hoity-toity abstain from sex nonsense that states so often like to sell to teenagers. We need discussions of consent from a young age as well as easily accessible birth control. The idea that birth control bills aren't over-the-counter in the US (as opposed to South Korea where they're OTC) is ridiculous! The whole thing reeks of immorality to me--of forcing people to ""pay"" for the ""crime"" of being sexually active. I resent that viewpoint immensely as a person who's had to unpack a ton of religious guilt around intimacy.

I kinda went off there, but you get the idea, poor soul who has to read these responses. (Hope you're doing OK today)"

I said i disagree it is our constitutional right, and they said guns are the reason there are so many shootings. When I stated that guns do not fire without the person making it they said that it is ridiculous and walked away.
The other person said that gun control would solve many problems. I said that the people who are wanting the guns want them bad enough they will find a way to get them similar to guns. They seemed irritated and I changed the subject to class work."

Leadership, regardless of the political spectrum, should prioritize transparency, respect for democratic norms, and policies that truly uplift all citizens without marginalizing any group.

In the case of Donald Trump, while he appealed to many who felt left behind by previous administrations, the consequences of his leadership—especially in terms of divisiveness, handling of key issues like immigration, and undermining democratic processes—raise serious concerns. I believe that while economic growth and certain policy successes are commendable, they cannot be seen in isolation from the broader impact on society, particularly when there is increased polarization, challenges to democracy, and erosion of trust in institutions. These issues should be critically considered when evaluating any presidency.

At the end of the day, the presidency isn't just about achieving short-term gains; it's about fostering long-term stability and unity. For me, that's a crucial aspect that should guide discussions and opinions on political leadership."

The aim is not to undermine responsible ownership but to address the heightened risks associated with these types of firearms. Enhanced regulations could help prevent their misuse and reduce the potential for mass violence while still respecting the rights of law-abiding gun owners.

I understand why pro choice is out there. Sometimes, that's what needs to happen in order to save the mother. Sometimes it's what's needed to happen because a child can't be supported in the environment that they are in. However, I still think that there are other options than to abort the child. If it's a health, safety, or mental risk for the mother, abortion might be the only answer. If it's because the mother doesn't want the child, maybe there is another option. The other person and I also talked about how women's rights are in the balance because someone is stating that a person can't choose if they can stop the pregnancy or not. I agree and disagree with that. When a woman gets pregnant, her body stops being hers because she's sharing it will another person. That's nature and reproduction.

I think laws criminalizing abortion or providing abortion access are extremely dangerous as abortions will happen with or without legality and regardless of your views on abortion, access to a clean and safe procedure is incredibly important. Additionally, I think that this issue has been the center of misinformation and better sex education about birth control specifically should be spread - but not necessarily at the federal level."

No politician is fully morally correct. Even Harris has her faults, she stutters when it comes to policies she's changed or some ideas that she won't speak on out of fear. Her economic knowledge is not where Trump is, she wants to do things in the capacity of what she can directly control whereas Trump does have a better plan for the long-term economy.

These debates provide a platform for candidates to discuss their visions for the country and address pressing issues directly.

Debates also help highlight contrasts between candidates, which can clarify where they stand on various issues. For voters, this means they can make more informed choices based on the candidates' responses, demeanor, and ability to handle complex questions.

However, debates can sometimes become more about performance and less about substance, which might overshadow deeper policy discussions. It’s important for viewers to look beyond the surface and consider the actual policies and track records of the candidates. Overall, debates are a valuable part of the democratic process, but they should be viewed as just one piece of the puzzle in evaluating presidential candidates."

My opinion now is that the most effective way to form a well-rounded understanding is by actively seeking out multiple sources of news—both from liberal and conservative outlets. By comparing these viewpoints, it becomes easier to see through biases and identify the core issues that matter to both parties.

I also believe it's important to look at independent and fact-based journalism, which strives to present the facts without catering to one political ideology.

"22074814668","I still hold on to my original belief. There wasn't much progress overall and many of their beliefs are based off fundamentals that are the complete opposite of mine. "
"22069633321","I haven't changed my opinion. I still clearly want to vote for Kamala Harris and she is still more on the fence about it, but I believe she is leaning more towards voting for Kamala now. "
"22617329752","I still believe that abortions are a decision that a woman should make early in a pregnancy. I support it in the cases of rape, incest, or children. However, with the morning after pill, women who think they may be pregnant or worried about pregnancy, should utilize this option more often."
"539875347","I have the same opinion on the issue I discussed. "
"22682395098","I believe many people have not taken their time to research kamala harris but instead are just listening to the media. "
"29239532112","I continue to hold the opinion I had before. The other person certainly had good points and for the most part, solid logic. However, the basis of my opinion is motivated by my views on life and the universe. There are a few beliefs that I cannot compromise on because of this. I do see how a different view on these essentials could lead to other opinions than my own, but it would take a whole life change for that view to make sense for me."
"22724266144",""
"114462273","Those who vote for Trump are generally blinded and brainwashed. Looking at real facts and evidence will reveal how terrible of a person he is."
"22913662206","I think that it is a nonissue. There are protections in place for biological women (testosterone limits, etc.). Some women have more T than others that doesn't mean they don't get to particpate, athletics is based on unfair inherent advantages in athletic people. The powerful in this country just needed another punching bag for people to focus on and they chose transgender people. Trans people in women sports is not a real problem."
"673470826","I was taken aback when the original conversation happened, and did not understand how looking at privilege as a gradient did not make sense. All my life, I have known people whose heritage and experience puts them somewhere in the middle of the gradient. I can see how a black person can see how closer I am to the white American privilege that they are on the opposite side of the gradient but lacks the perspective of how a white American can see how I am closer to the black American privilege or lack thereof. I'm not mad or take much offense to it, but find it irritating that  I could not impart that perspective with them to see the world how I see it."
"22880903773","My opinion is that abortion should be illegal, with exception of the few cases where the mother's life is in jeopardy."
"22617261232","The issues discussed were not very productive. The other individuals did not have an open mind and were not willing to hear any alternative ideas."
"302390872","We discussed the abortion laws, with her being pro-choice and I, pro-life. She explained to me her reasoning and why certain circumstances should allow abortions to which I agreed, but within reason. "
"903557335","I think my general view on Trump is still the same, but I'm starting to increase my understanding of why some people would vote for Trump."
"22442877509","I have the same opinion I had before the conversation. It's taken me years to understand my own beliefs and why I believe them, independent of my parents. I feel confident in the conclusions I've made, but I also respect my parents beliefs that they also spent years understanding and deciding on."
"572604438","My opinion is the same of the issue I disccused. I still believe that immigration, both illegal and legal should be severely restricted. We have too many people that are coming into the country which increases competition for resources such as jobs and housing. "
"22684412342","I still agree that abortions should be a right for any woman who lives in America because it is their choice what they do with their body and not someone else's. (Should not be used as a form of birth control)"
"22147800865","We've come to an agreement that something must be done because the problem seems to be increasing and will only get worse as time goes on."
"22352983073","I think that political violence is unacceptable if they are a candidate, and also if they hold political office under the condition that they were fairly elected. Making jokes or using rhetoric that specifically endorse political violence is unacceptable and people who do so should be held accountable if it is shown that their rhetoric directly influenced their actions."
"22770682169","Both candidates have a whole graveyard of skeletons in thier closet, but the way the discussion went about was not just playing moral equavalancy but rather stating different reasons of what made the candidates untrustworthy. With the evolution of Trump rasing suspicion with the persion I spoke with. Stating that overtime to former president has changed ot be less calculated and more theoatrical."
"349570249","Vote for Kamala Harris.                               "
"22033390846","In light of the individual's limited understanding, my position remains unchanged. While I can comprehend the rationale behind America's support for Israel based on its resources, I cannot endorse any actions that contribute to the ongoing suffering of a people, particularly when driven by interests related to resource exploitation."
"344250631","My opinion remains the same since the students was clearly not able to give a convincing response. The student showed no facts or knowledge, and when history was mentioned, did not provided any evidence on said history. The students clearly showed a bias view point, and made it seem like their opinion matters more than others"
"22953006492","Having to choose between the ""least terrible of the two"" is detrimental to the American political system and the American people. The two candidates often have to utilize ""at least I'm not xxxx who does yyyy"" rather than discussing how they want to make America better when they're in office. The American people are aggressively being driven towards a civil war over candidates they really shouldn't want to do such for."
"22119425173","Any assassination attempt on a presidential candidate is a despicable act. I dislike Donald Trump immensely; I think 4 more years of him would be disastrous for America. However, he should not be subject to violence, and if he wins the presidency without it being a stolen election, then he should become president. I worry that the violence will continue and potentially spread to other politicians. I think that Biden and Harris should do more than put out statements saying how horrible it is. If they could get Trump to agree to it, they should hold a news conference together speaking out against the violence and showing an ounce of collaboration."
"913909966","The opinion that I had before is that Israel has rights to the land it possesses and that Hamas initiated the conflict. The idea that I had after the conversation is the exact same but I also feel that there should be some peace seeking diplomacy in action. I still completely understand the sovereignty of the Israeli nation and their choice to continue the total destruction of the Hamas terrorist group. I also still support Israel."
"28841489896","My opinion is the same as it was before the conversation."
"22005241207","My opinion is mostly the same with a bit more disdain for people that support him because of his newer policies that I was not aware of. "
"22904771461","My opinion has been shaped in some ways by insights provided by my friend. This is because I missed some facts and was misled by polarized information. "
"22432259434","I don't think my opinion has changed since the discussion with my father. I think more so my view of him as a person changed. I still stand by my own argument and view of women's rights and abortion."
"587535494","My opinion on the issue of reasoning who to vote for is that I feel like Kamala would benefit my future in the long run. But I completely understand his reasoning for wanting to vote for Trump. Trump does have better relationships with other world leaders which helps us stray away from having a war. "
"22014615511","My opinion did not change as a result of the discussion, I still think that Kamala Harris on the debate and is the better candidate for presidency, however the other student did convince me that both candidates have faults"
"22863157110","I still have the same opinions, but now have a better understanding of the other side."
"22628794608","It stands the same. My opinion hasn't changed."
"22141944572","I attended her church and her pastor went on a long rant about immigrants of godless people flooding our area as a serious problem.  Christian values are to care for and welcome all people.  So, I've learned her church is very biased and dealing with her/their ignorance is the price of our friendship, at least, one of them."
"22797398570","There really was no issue in the previous student's prompt. They appear to have no opinions of their own. "
"22722295890","Donald Trump's ""America First"" policies focused on boosting domestic industries through tariffs, deregulation, and tax cuts. While these moves temporarily strengthened certain sectors and lowered unemployment, they also contributed to trade tensions, particularly with China. Critics argue that these policies, coupled with rising deficits, laid the groundwork for inflationary pressures seen during and after the pandemic, as global supply chains and international cooperation were strained. Balancing short-term gains with long-term economic stability remains a challenge."
"22398628950","Trump will make a better president because he will keep . economy running the U.S efficiently."
"22419127183","My opinion of the issue has not changed, as I am still anti-gun, and very pro choice. However, I think that I have a better grasp of why other people may be not happy about gun control or access to abortions."
"22479227816","I was a little upset someone I love did not agree with me, but I understand that there are different ideas of people and their own idea of why they like certain candidates"
"22047646174","I believe the Academy should be much harder and longer to weed out unqualified candidates who are not fit enough to feel safe unless they use deadly force. I believe there should be an extremely heavy emphasis on de-escalation and on working with mentally ill populations. There should be regular mandatory trainings and physicals so that police don't get lazy or complacent. They should always be bettering themselves and trying to be a better cop. "
"22221515398","My opinion is still valid but that doesn't mean I don't agree with her. She had some interesting points and I was very open-minded of her points."
"22094452435","I believe did the right thing by stating facts with backed-up credible sources and not just stating my opinions. It helps because this way, I am not spreading misinformation, unlike other people. "
"22106611854","I still hold the same perspective because it aligns with my personal moral values. I did not enter the conversation thinking that it would be any sort of attempt to change each other's mind. I was just curious to hear the other person's perspective."
"22751456213","The issue we discussed was immigration and how Trump voiced his opinion on it. I believe he has made very nasty and rude comments that are not entirely true like immigrants coming into this country and bringing drugs and all of them being criminals. Along with racist remarks such as saying immigrants are eating cats and dogs. The person I had the conversation with defended Donald Trump because they think he is honest and not afraid to say what's on his mind. I believe he should think about what he says more often."
"22432913318","My opinion hasn't changed, I think some gun control is a good thing, but I don't think it should be so stringent as to exclude regular people who want firearms for legitimate reasons. Bad actors, who are usually very determined, will always find ways to obtain firearms or cause harm otherwise. The best approach is somewhere in the middle."
"22673231116","Its the same I didn't really feel that influenced, her arguments landed more on the emotional side. "
"22859238500","We discussed many issues, including gun control, and the Israeli war in Gaza and we discussed voting candidates who will solve all these problems. "
"22768903027","I hold to my beliefs and see the perspective of the opposition."
"22058888441","My opinion now is still the same about my political party. The conversation was respectful and feel really strongly about my views and also listed to the opposing parties thoughts. "
"22522776694","My opinion remains the same, and I still believe that Donald Trump is not a good candidate for presidency "
"22601663011","I was always in support of the amendment, and this conversation didn't change my views on the matter. "
"22572082169","That’s a common challenge in political discussions where strong emotions are involved. Reflecting on that experience, it reinforces how polarized certain topics can be, particularly when it comes to figures like Donald Trump who elicit passionate responses from both sides.

In situations like this, I think it’s important to recognize when a topic becomes too heated and to refocus on shared values or less contentious issues. My opinion remains that while it’s valuable to discuss politics openly, it’s just as important to maintain mutual respect and recognize when a conversation is no longer productive. Sometimes, taking a step back and focusing on areas where common ground can be found—whether on policy or general principles—might be a better approach."
"22455367259","It was discussed because of what's going on in Palestine. The war that has started because our country is supporting that war. As if The USA was supposed to be the middle man and make everything better and come to peace. The land of the free, but nobody's is ever free here. "
"22103781264","We discussed Trump's performance in the election and Tim Walz specifically. How his debate will go, how he is as a person, etc."
"22292415834","I don't think its as fine of a line between right and wrong, but instead of who wins and who loses. Somebody is going to win if the border is tighter and somebody is going to win if the border is looser."
"22085541748","My opinion of the issue remains the same. I believe that everyone has a choice. I personally do not believe in abortion unless there is something serious at hand. I could not imagine making my daughter carry a child at 12 after abuse. But if someone else decides that they want to make that choice, then that is on them. "
"22404841333","I still will support Donald Trump and Israel as they have proven they should only attack when provoked and not for greed "
"893337141","I am able to see why we had different opinions. My friend, who is a Muslim most likely supported Palestine due to his religious beliefs, whereas I did the same thing for Israel for my own religious beliefs as well."
"22044864472","I stated facts to this individual and they let opinion get in the way"
"22824424209","After discussing the previous passage, it was very argumentative on the opposing side, whereas I took the view of using a larger scope to obtain what is best for our country, not what a personality is. "
"873990170","i am more inclined to agree with them and see their point of view"
"592771824","I think I had my mind opened a bit to the other side of the argument. There were things that I had not considered when taking my side, however, the reasoning behind the opposing side did not fully change my stance but I do think it made me more tolerable of it. "
"22090099445","I believe inflation has been caused by massive government printing and overspending. The crisis we have seen in our supermarkets is due to the value of the dollar deflating, probably more than is reported. I believe this both due to the massive government spending we've seen and due to the economics of businesses not being able to simply raise prices for no reason. If someone could enter the market and do it for cheaper, they would get more business."
"22092154903","N/A"
"22116584141","Mostly unchanged. What I found eye-opening about the conversation was witnessing and digesting the outsider's perspective on the situation."
"22248647101","My opinion stayed the same. She had no information to back her stance and nothing that we discussed changed my way of thinking. "
"22365579565","I haven't really changed my opinion. I think a lot of political discussion is dominated by fear, rather than listening to the other side, and I hope that people don't let that fear cloud their ability to see reality."
"22319166755","My opinion on gun control has remained unchanged. The other person's argument was that it isn't the guns, but the people who kill people. While I agree that bad people are part of the issue, if guns were not so readily available, there would not be as much death. Guns make it easy to kill, and they make it easy to make a rash decision without much thought. If there were stricter gun laws, shootings would be significantly reduced. Someone can not shoot someone without a gun. "
"22199186018","I think it's difficult for people to understand right and wrong if they have been fed misinformation. I am personally supporting Kamala Harris simply because we need to make sure Trump doesn't win since he is planning to completely shatter the current governmental structure and system. I think that our country's overall wellbeing is at stake and this is much more about that than about the two individuals running for president."
"22145264147","I discussed abortion. I listened to the other person's views, and they were based on their religion/how they were raised. Although I can understand other viewpoints on the topic, I did not agree with the reasons this student gave for their opinion. "
"331032872","My opinion hasn't changed. My stance on abortion comes from my understanding of logic and philosophy. The fundamental question is: when does life begin? No one can give me a clear answer on that. So I will err on the side of caution and oppose abortion."
"28568829789","I still maintain my stance in the discussion because I have researched the topic beforehand and did more research after the discussion to ensure my stance was correct."
"22576595011","My opinion was that vaccinations should be individual choices, as there are benefits and downsides to both being vaccinated or unvaccinated. This opinion hasn't changed since because I haven't been persuaded otherwise."
"22230941985","still the same, I know my facts and even after putting others words into consideration know them not to be true"
"22582696695","I think that in an ideal world, abortion would be outlawed entirely, save for very scant exceptions, but that this is unworkable for a number of reasons as things stand. In the meantime, leaving it to the states, as the Roe reversal does, gives the people the ability to express their wishes, rather than a federal overreach."
"22991138331","I still feel strongly about what I said. The individual that I had the conversation with was extremely respectful and there was not downgrading either political party nor was there name-calling."
"293905050","Reflecting on past conversations about politics with people holding opposing views, I believe that these discussions can be valuable for understanding the nuances behind different perspectives. "
"22491980706","I don't have very strong opinions."
"23396232330","My position hasn't really changed, though I understood some of the view points they possessed. However, the view points are common view points possessed by the majority of the opposing side, so I feel as if it did not really have an influence on me."
"22914027786","The issue discussed allowed me to engage in a conversation with someone who has a different perspective and point of view than me but putting that difference aside I still enjoy and respect the individual. Having political conversations or ones where more differences can be had shows the importance of being open minded while avoiding trying to sway someone's opinion to be your own."
"22575833716","In general, I am not in support of abortion, because it requires killing an innocent life, however, there are some circumstances in which abortion is slightly more reasonable. This includes if the women is pregnant from rape or other coercive measures or following through with the pregnancy will 100% lead to the death of the woman. If neither of these are the case, I am fully pro life. There are many organizations that are available to support the woman through motherhood or orphanages to take care of the baby, so there is no excuse to not keep the baby. As I heard once, abortion should not be a form of contraception."
"22507592546","My opinion remains the same on many things from the debate. The only difference that I have from before is the professionalism of each candidate, as Kamala grew more professional and Trump grew less professional. "
"22014568884","I still have the same opinions, but I can understand more where his views come from. "
"23266252302","I believe that trump is right. I believe that if people keep trying to assassinate trump, there will be something big that happens. Either with protection or something else."
"22324176195","Firm stance on using racism or stereotypes to sway people against each other is wrong."
"22666017316","I hold the same views about the issues we discussed. My friends ideas had no logic behind them and I didn't learn anything new."
"22852973361","I believe that people can make a difference in their community but we need help from our government officials to bring that movement to a larger scale and that they aren't fulfilling their duties"
"22090323297","My opinion has remained the same post discussion with my friend. I find that the problem with many political discussions in that our country is so strongly and fervently bipartisan that very few people are willing to actually challenge their decided party or their own individual thinking. I am scared for what the future looks like as individuals become more and more extreme in their refusal to even engage with others based on party and politics. "
"22777268749","My opinion is still undecided. I still don't know who I want to vote for because it seems like all I ever hear about both candidates is negative which makes it very challenging to decide who I agree with more."
"22445179562","I still think working against the institution from within isn't a very productive use of time, but I better understand how change can be made from inside."
"22057636326","Focusing especially on the conversation I had with my friend, because it was more aligned with wanting to connect than it was with my family member. My opinion hasn't changed because I don't feel like I was challenged by information that I hadn't heard and critically thought about before. Especially in the second conversation, where we were both interested in being ""right"" rather than understanding each others perspective because we're sure it's non-negotiable to our beliefs"
"22336532045","about the same, but interresting to hear their take"
"22828130535","I still support clean energy sources because global warming is a scientifically measurable phenomenon. Due to how long it takes to convert to those energy sources, I think it's essential to place a heavy emphasis on changing now."
"22904997023","I stand by everything I say. I lean more left in my beliefs."
"22700028854","I believe the same as I did before, but I feel I understand the opposing side more. Conspiracy theories are a real thing that I have to accept exist, even if I don't accept their truth. People can believe in the least likely situation."
"22102730280","My opinion of this issue is that men should be careful when discussing the rights of women's bodies because it's hard to discuss issues that they personally don't have direct knowledge of in their own lives. Overall, a man should not get to decide what a woman does with her body and vice versa."
"22641625024",""
"22301928937","My view has not changed, necessarily, but I do know more about the perspective held by individuals of similar thoughts as the person I spoke with. I realize now that politics, and almost everything else we disagree on as humans, is more nuanced than we like to admit."
"22472998159","It's the same, I hate taking sides and I choose to learn and take away meaningful information rather than point fingers and pick sides. There is no such thing as perfect, in politics especially, and I feel bad for people who don't have the capacity to think beyond bias and strong emotions."
"22294091767","I still believe that green energy is an effective and efficient method, but I can understand why some people may see this as being a waste of time and effort."
"22811718649","We discussed immigration after the person came back from a trip and said the homeless crisis was out of control. They stated that American citizens should not be homeless when immigrants ""live so well off"". They went on to state that this is what happens when ""we just let anyone in"". I think I was so focused on not telling them right away why they were wrong, that I just let them speak and let them think they were right. I wasn't confident in telling them why I didn't agree because I didn't want the conversation to go south. I wanted it to remain civil on both ends."
"22955662248","i think that larger political topics cannot be addressed collectively, and must be carefully considered and discussed on an individual basis"
"22762837395","Abortion is the topic that was discussed. I was informed of the opposing parties views, which was a complete pro-choice opinion. I was able to bring up points where the baby is a separate person and not a ""parasite."" If a person relying on others is considered a parasite, then old people/people with disabilities are considered parasites. My opinion has been wavered slightly on cases with incest and rape. I still do not have solid opinions concerning those cases, however, I believe all life should be attempted to be saved as much as possible."
"22032853520","I don’t support Trump or Kamala Harris, but I feel like Kamala could be more ethical than Trump. She’s younger and seems more reasonable in how she approaches things. While I don’t agree with everything she stands for, I think her leadership style might be less divisive and more focused on bringing people together compared to Trump."
"22205273095","Since we talked about the presidential debate we discussed a pretty wide range of topics. Overall, my opinion is that Donald Trump spewed about 2 hours of unhinged nonsense and badly lost the debate. Only time will tell if it changed the minds of any voters."
"22873234498","Donald Trump is seen by his supporters as a strong, decisive leader who prioritizes America’s interests above all else. During his presidency, Trump implemented tax cuts that spurred economic growth, deregulated many industries to encourage business development, and focused on bringing jobs back to the U.S. through a tough stance on trade, particularly with China. His ""America First"" agenda resonated with millions of people who felt left behind by the political establishment. Supporters argue that Trump improved the economy, particularly before the pandemic, and brought attention to issues like immigration reform and national security.

In terms of foreign policy, Trump’s willingness to engage with adversaries like North Korea, his efforts to broker peace deals in the Middle East, and his insistence on NATO allies contributing more to defense spending were seen as bold moves that redefined traditional diplomacy. Many Republicans appreciated his direct approach to problems, even if it was unconventional."
"22596856811","I have the same opinion that Trump should not be president simply because of the type of person he is and the overarching fact that his a CONVICTED criminal."
"547691218","Mainly the same with more insight."
"22846807284","My opinion is unchanged"
"22751966118","The opinion is the same. "
"22321752776","My opinion remains unchanged. I have not been presented with anything to sway my beliefs and I believe I am very moderately between beliefs of most people on ""left"" and ""right"""
"827174873","My opinion on Hamas-Isreal conflict is still unchanged (I strongly support Palestine). This is because I still do not see the acts of Hamas and dozens of Isreali lives (tragically) lost to remotely compare to the injustices of the Isreali government towards Palestinians/ within the greater Middle East whether that be through the tens of thousands of lives lost, innocent civilians impacted, international laws broken... In my opinion, there is a clear and obvious immense aggressor to which Palestine deserves the world's help to combat; the Palestinians cannot be expected to be the 'perfect victim' and Hamas is an unfortunate result of this brutal occupation. Thus, irrespective of any argument in support for an Isreali state or the right of Isreal to combat Hamas, I support the Palestinian people first. Although, this conversation aided me to better understand some of the reasons behind why an individual may support Israel and a perspective that spans outside of simply 'holy land' or a right to Jewish state. My friend uniquely brought up the long-term implications a Palestinian state would have on the region which I found to be interesting."
"22817015725","We had a nice discussion about the issues of the day. We agreed Kamala Harris should be doing more interviews and that Trump's latest comments were a bit out there and crazy. I think it was a great conversation and I hope to have more like it."
"22070789393","That queerness is inherant to me as your love for football and tractors."
"22485056400","It makes me realize that it depends on the person. If someone is so influenced by propoganda and outside factors, they will be more likely to be stubborn."
"22241556236","Much of the conversation consisted of the issue surrounding abortion. I have not moved from my position on this matter, and it is more likely than not that I never will. While I can see some of the reasoning behind being pro-choice, I do believe that, at the core, it is the woman's decision to go through with it. Abortion is not just something to ""kill a baby""; it is a form of healthcare, one that many women (and young women/girls) have died and will die without, and a total ban of it is wrong to commit to. I can see the reasoning behind wanting to preserve life, and will never beat down on someone for it; but to risk the life and safety of the individual carrying the child (or potentially even the child themselves) is wrong. Preserving a life only to put it/others in danger or to bring suffering is not life."
"22966900254","I still feel the same about the issue. While I understand some of pro-life supporters stances, I 100% believe in every fully developed human being, having control over their own bodies."
"22048542458","I now think that the money raised from the unrealized gains tax could be used to help Americans. It could go into healthcare programs, help the quickly draining social security fund, create a program which gives credits for homebuyers, or otherwise help lower the cost of living for Americans. However, I still just don't trust the government enough to approve a plan which would truly help the American people without any weird loopholes. I feel that a bill with a groundbreaking tax proposal like this would have to include all types of compromises, including increased aid to Ukraine, changing other policies established by the government, or lowering taxes in other sectors that interest members of congress, decreasing the amount of net funds gained by the bill and putting more money in the pockets of congressmen. "

I think this because I believe that for many reasons, but one is that if we decide that once someone is ""unreasonable"" enough that we can forcibly medicate them, I believe it can be a slippery slope that eventually leads to overwhelming control and silencing of people."
"22884574723","I believe that immigration is good for this country, but currently our policies create the worst of both worlds. Purely logistically, having hundreds of thousands or millions of immigrants enter illegally every year puts a strain on the system. The solution is not mass deportation or inhumane treatment. The solution is cleaning up the process for legal immigration and providing a path to documentation for existing undocumented immigrants."

But our country was based on the arrival of immigrants, and we would be doing disservice to ourselves in so many different ways by not at least trying to welcome them here and show them that we can be good for them as much as they can be for us through education, creativity, and so much more."
"22613210719","Abortion is a very simple matter when it comes to our bodies. Taking away the right to choose to carry and abort is as simple as a human right. It is traumatic to carry full term if the baby is a product of crime (rape, incest, trafficking). I strongly believe surgical procedures shouldn'thave consequences that result in fines and fires, the female should always have a choice. Criminally she didnt have a say in her rape, getting involved ancestrally, or being trafficked, so why not give her the say in what happens to the baby. "

The respectful dialogue allowed me to see the nuances that I hadn’t considered before, reinforcing the idea that political issues are rarely black and white.

I understand what they mean by we should not be allowed to kill an innocent unborn life. I agree with them that if the woman simply doesn't want the baby after having unprotected sex, then she should have taken precausions. however, I also think that if the mom does not want the baby then the baby will have a terrible life if he is unwanted.

We both came to the same answer that Trump did wonderful things for the economy, but is not influenced in politics which makes him not the best candidate. While Kamala is more knowledgeable in politics based off of her history, but cares less about the economy. Overall, we would rather there be another candidate."

"22194912875","The issue we discussed was the issue of immigration and the increasing number of illegal immigrants coming into America. While I still believe that much of Trump's rhetoric about illegal immigrants is based on fear-mongering, racism, and xenophobia, the conversation did open my eyes to the idea that with the US getting out of the COVID recession, it should be the government's first priority to help uplift Americans and issues like homelessness, class inequality, and racial inequality, before we can welcome all these people into the country and promise to help them and give them jobs."

"26517743709","On the topic of abortion rights, I will always be pro-choice. As a woman, I do not believe it is within my rights to tell another woman what she is allowed to do with her own body. As adult human beings, we know what is best for ourselves and our bodies and we should be given as much bodily autonomy as men are. Instead, men are given more power over our bodies than we have over our bodies, which is absolutely infuriating. It is almost unbelievable how America would rather let fully formed, mature, adult women bleed out in emergency rooms instead of allowing abortion access. I cannot believe how my government tries to prioritize unborn fetuses over adult women. I cannot believe men get to have as much of a say in it as they do, when most men cannot even explain the basics of menstruation, pregnancy, or childbirth (because they don't care about the woman, or even the child after it's born. They just care that it's born.) It is very hard, as an American woman, to have any hope. Kamala gives us that hope."

Me and the person I was talking with do not hold very strong beliefs about many issues and thus didn't have a major disagreement, more like a mini debate. A lot of agreement occurred, as we sit closer to the middle on the issues, just both of us slightly leaning in different directions."
"22432279308","I don't think my opinion has changed about the mandate for covid vaccines during the pandemic, but it did make me think and it did raise questions for me. I would like to know more about the science behind the vaccine and the side effects that people are experiencing. The person I talked to clearly believes in the science behind it, which I think is what intrigued me the most. I the past I have discounted people who are anti-vaccine outright. "
"22618264796","they are still ill informed"
"22779966511","I woudn't say my opinion, per se, has changed. I am however going to try and change how I approach conversations about the political candidates. I don't support Trump, but I used to, and the same reasons I and others did still hold true today. People feel like they aren't listened to, that politics are corrupt, and that Trump is a kind of ""outsider"" that can fix this mess. The way to approach that is not ""well he's a felon and you're an idiot,"" but by proving them wrong BY listening."
"22545338100","It didn't change much. I still don't agree with her and I've done enough research to know I'm a leftist. Any conservative talking points tends to just solidify that belief because I get reminded of why I'm a leftist. I listen, I consider it, there's good stuff here and there that I may agree with (like we need more manufacturing jobs), but I usually have a different perspective on a lot of issues. "
"22197684967"," I think my roommates opinion on what I suppose could be better described as an encompassing an encompassing conversation about cancel culture, was largely informal by his background as a person who has never been in a position where he would be offended by something intended to cause offense on a massive scale to a specific group of people. Because he had never had firsthand experience, he has not developed a properly empathetic response to such a plight. "
"22540824964","My opinions have not changed. I haven't had another conversation with this person, and reading other perspectives in this study did not exactly help with that. I still tryingly believe Harris will be a greater president for those who are not white, rich men. "
"22606310059","My opinion is that out of the two conversations, even though they both shared different views, I saw that one person (even with different views) was on the same page as me about having conversations and connecting with others. While, the other was more concerned / afraid of losing or fighting. "
"22487790605","my opinion has not changed but i gained insight into why my mom is voting the way she is. i learned that at different ages we have different issues we care about. my mom is voting for Kamala Harris because of her own battles with healthcare and housing. she believes that Kamala will pass policy that will benefit her more than the other candidate. 

i cant argue with that! that is a perfectly normal reason for wanting to vote democrat. people expect us to have a solid stance on every issue and be ready to defend it. I think that even if someone votes because of only 1 issue that that is better than them not voting at all. that's the whole point of voting! we vote for who we want. not for who other people want. 

i told my mom that i valued world peace and the stability of the United States in world politics. it wasn't that i didn't value her healthcare, shes my mom! of course i value healthcare and want my mom to have the best available. i also know that presidents often don't hold true to many of their promises. many of the policy promises don't rely on the candidate as much as it relies on the house or senate. 

I explained to my mom that with the war in gaza and ukraine, Trump would lead to more global security. this is simply a difference in opinion. the two opposing sides were voting for Kamala or Trump. but what we really talked about was how my mom values healthcare above most else and i value US security. most people would agree on the need of these two things but we simply put them higher or lower than one another on our personal list of values. whether trump will lead to a safer US or Kamla will lead to better healthcare is currently unknown. its all just promises as of now. 

we ended the conversation when we stopped talking about our personal beliefs and started talking about the candidate themselves. at this point we were jokingly throwing insults about the other candidate but in good faith. shortly after we both realised that we had talked all we wanted to and since it got to the candidate specifically it was best to just agree to disagree. "
"22335693188","Kamala Harris is dangerous for Palestine and Trump is dangerous for immigration process and foreign policy."
"22354146986","My opinion remains the same. You can't use the slogan ""all lives matter"" to ban abortion when it is harming the lives of pregnant women.  Those that become sick during pregnancy and die unnecessarily because a doctor had his hands tied is unacceptable. I do agree that late term abortions should be banned for those who change their minds and no longer want a child, but when it comes to the life of the mother, why is her life not as important as the child she is carrying?"
"22636729967","I understand voting for Kamala Harris or Donald Trump based on party, specifically for the people that run beneath them, but based on character and track record alone, I believe that Kamala is much more competent, honest, and a better symbol for our country.  I like that Donald Trump is ""for America"", and tackles issues like immigration, but his way of speaking and track record of lies is simply too much to handle.  Putting him on the global stage as America's leader is a liability."
"22458509420","My opinion has not changed. I am still very pro-choice and nothing they were saying really changed that. "
"22344300153","I think immigration is a difficult issue, but overall that the U.S. should allow for more legal immigration. The quality of living conditions at the border is extremely poor and the majority of immigrants are fleeing poor conditions for the hopes of a better life, which is the American Dream. Beyond that, I think the fortunate have a moral imperative to help the less fortunate and this is one of those situations. "

"22093093063","My opinion never changed. I've always been for more gun control. The point of the discussion was about how we needed more gun control in America. They did not agree until we spoke about the two different people who attempted to assassinate trump and how easy it must have been for them to obtain guns because they were white men so most people don't even bat an eye at the fact that they would have or need guns. That is a major issue and I managed to persuade their opposing view on at least that issue."
"22052556449","My opinion is definitely still the same. I think I just learned more about how people from the other perspective view this issue but that did not change how I viewed things."
"22742696465","Recently, I had two conversations with individuals regarding the recent political debate, and one of the main topics we discussed was the upcoming expiration of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). These discussions really reinforced how critical it is that the TCJA doesn't expire, as the decision to extend or let it lapse will have significant consequences for millions of Americans.

The potential expiration of the TCJA is a major concern because if it is not extended, we would revert back to the 2017 tax laws, which could result in higher taxes for many individuals and businesses. For example, the standard deduction, which nearly doubled under the TCJA, would shrink back to its pre-2018 levels, meaning many families would lose a significant portion of their current tax breaks. Income tax rates would also increase across the board, impacting taxpayers in every income bracket. In addition, the child tax credit would be reduced, making it harder for families to manage their finances.

It’s scary to think that the person elected into office could be the one to decide whether the TCJA continues or expires. This is a critical issue that will affect not just businesses, but everyday Americans who rely on these tax cuts to ease their financial burdens. The conversations reminded me just how important it is to ensure policies like the TCJA remain in place to support economic growth and stability."

"499788322","Reflecting on that recent conversation about politics, I realize that while we may have differing views, the underlying issues we discussed—like job creation and immigration—are important to both sides. I still believe that collaboration is essential for addressing complex challenges, and it's crucial to move beyond the polarized rhetoric. Engaging with opposing perspectives helped me understand the values that drive those beliefs, which often stem from a desire for stability and security. Finding common ground on key issues can lead to more effective solutions. Overall, I appreciate the opportunity to dialogue, as it fosters empathy and encourages a more nuanced understanding of the political landscape."
"22683710245","I think that there should be more laws to limit where large entities (in terms of net worth and profit) put their money. I do believe wealth hoarding is a problem, and I want there to be something done about it. The person I talked to now agrees there is a problem, but says laws will not fix it. It is the consumer's right and freedom to not support the wealth hoarding companies. I disagreed and said that the wealth gap, which I believe is there because of wealth hoarding, prevents individuals from having the financial freedom to chose companies that are ethical or buy local goods. I can't remember what he said, but it convinced me that these companies are somewhat necessary because they provide jobs, goods, and services to the very people who can't afford to support ethical companies. "
"863221279","I think that nothing about my opinion has changed since this discussion. I always learn more by talking to people with opposing views, especially since we do not always get our information from the same place. Nothing that we discussed really persuaded me to think differently, but I personally do not have the strongest feeling about politics in general. I think overall, the 2 party system is one of the worst things to happen to America, and just like Lincoln said ""a house divided cannot stand."" I think that it is hard to get just facts these days because all news sources are biased and share their opinions with the facts. I hope that in every conversation I have about politics that both people can learn more from one another in order to form their own opinions amongst the propaganda. "
"22959161014","I still hold the opinion that abortion is wrong.  I do not beleive this is a personal body choice or a rights choice.  I think that the child conceived, even in embryotic stage, should have the right to live.  I believe there are cases when abortion is medically necessary.  But I am and will never be persuaded to believe that abortion should be a choice for someone who is not in dire medical condtion.  Adoption is a viable option that maintains life and rids the person of their responsibilities the same. "
"381237774","We discussed gun control and my opinion has not changed. It just became clear to me that most republicans are miss informed that the democrats want to take their guns but that is not the case.

The people I know with opposing views are close friends of mine, but I haven't known them long enough that I feel comfortable sharing my political views and having a genuine discussion yet. When my friends think about how I'm different from them, I want them to think about how I like the Bears and they like the Packers, or how I like Future and they like Zach Bryan, not our political differences."
"22215422145","After reflecting on the conversation, my opinion remains that voting is crucial, especially in this election. I believe that democracy and human rights, particularly for marginalized communities like the LGBTQ+ population, are at significant risk. While I understand the frustration some people feel about the flaws in both political sides, I see voting as a way to influence and safeguard the values I care about. Inaction only allows those with opposing agendas to dominate. So, even if the system isn’t perfect, participation is essential to push for progress and accountability."

"22565935493","I feel heated but I still feel like it's possible to keep these kinds of conversations cordial. You can't persuade someone so strongheaded to think a different way because they're not willing to change their mind and there be the chance of them ""being wrong."" That's why I feel like it's better to have a calm conversation about intense topics like politics."

"22844765842","My opinion is still the same, and it hasn't changed because Trump's speech at the Presidential debate sealed the deal for me. Trump was talking in circles and hardly made any sense. I am still confused how people can understand and believe all what comes out of his mouth."

"22614443181","I think most Trump voters cite economic and foreign policy issues as their reasons for supporting him, but after cursory research it's quite easy to fact-check and debunk many of their points. I think those issues serve as easy, morally neutral issues to speak about in order to deflect from other more dubiously moral viewpoints that they might be in agreement with Trump about, like xenophobia, racism, sexism, and homophobia."

"22676182850","The wording of this question is unclear but I assume this is in reference to the discussion of abortion from the last survey? 

I am very strongly in favor of the right to abortion. I don't believe that the government should be making decisions about the ""sanctity"" of life that can and do affect whether women can get the health care they need. In the months since Roe v. Wade was overturned, my opinion has been strengthened by the evidence that anti-choice laws in numerous states have made it hard for women to access routine medical care even in the case of wanted pregnancies. I'm very concerned for women's rights around the country, even though I live in a solidly blue state where I don't immediately fear for my own medical rights. I am especially concerned by the religious foundation of the anti-choice movement, which is in stark opposition to the separation of church and state. As an atheist, the separation of church and state is one of the most important aspects of American democracy in my view. "
"22565360998","My opinion on the issue has not changed. I believe that competence should be given credit before one's ancestry or ethnicity. As well as the fact that first we need to make child care and health care affordable before forcing people to keep kids. A car seat should not cost $200 and an 800g of baby formula should NOT cost $50. Absolutely not. treat humans as humans. Don't make feeding a baby so unaffordable for parents."
"204684502","its tragic"
"22068574953","My opinion is that both Democrats and Republicans like to sit in gridlock more than actually solve issues and admit common ground.  I think that the political game of preventing the other party from getting any meaningful solutions (which both sides may support like child tax credit) passed is a pathetic power play. I think that approval voting would be an interesting change since candidates would have to be likeable instead of just who do you dislike the least."
"22611606493","My opinion is unchanged on the issue we discussed. I doubt any limited conversation would change my feeling as to me it is a matter of basic human rights to healthcare that I would not change my mind on."

"22062632353","I believe a president should have a commitment to integrity in governance, ethical leadership, and policies that prioritize both economic stability and human rights. Donald Trump's presidency was marred by instability and unethical dealings. Integrity is the last word that should be used to describe Trump."
"22931274906","My opinion on gun rights is still that we need to find a way to do backround checks or limit the way people can get guns but I think we do have to do it with careful consideration of the constitution and that is possible but the narrative has become that you can't have one without the other."

"22242060073","The conversation was very civil because we were open-minded. The student that I just responded to seemed to be very close-minded about Donald Trump which made it very hard to communicate compared to the past conversation. I think it is important to be respectful and understanding during these conversations."

I believe a woman should be able to have control of her body and her future, and be able to receive a healthy and safe abortion whether it was because she was raped at age 8 or because she is an adult who simply doesn't feel like having a baby. I am atheist, so the points my mom made based on her Christian values did not influence me at all. Observing the facts I know and the rights and feelings of women, I am still strongly Pro-Choice."

"22486610864","It's the same, I disagree but now it's weird that there are people who think the opposite of me. I just can't understand why what they think will play out the way they think it will when I think it's a recipe for disaster (hyperbole)."
"22366495927","In my opinion, sports gambling is a tax on men with addictive personalities and underdeveloped prefrontal cortex and that the benefits to the country of banning it vastly outweigh the benefits of legalization. Recent evidence, which I heard through Freakanomics or NPR podcast (pretty good not bulletproof sources), pointed out that the rate of savings and investment for men in states with legalized gambling was significantly lower and I heard in class that states where gambling is legal have much more expensive premiums on loans, understanding at some point the availability of gambling makes men less likely to pay them back. No significant liberty is infringed, in my opinion, by banning sports gambling: it is not integral to the pursuit of happiness. "

Even after my conversation, my opinion of him did not change but by talking to the other person, I could get an insight into why they thought Trump was the better option due to his optical party, past actions, and promises he made in his campaign. My opinion of him is too strong to change just based off one conversation. "
