"25289616758","You need to apologize to the family that you've hurt, because even though you have hurt some of them they still care for you enough to take care of you when you were sick despite how unappreciative you were. "
"29729788140","I did not appreciate the way you brought up the topic about my skin. I would have appreciated if you had asked me first instead of making a joke out of it. My insecurities are not for entertainment. "
"25453791797","Personal. "
"23136067284","Hey Matteius, I wanted to talk to you about something that’s been on my mind. During our last conversation, I felt like the way you expressed your opinion kind of shut down the discussion. I get that you’re passionate about what you were saying, but the way it came across made it tough for others to engage. I think it’s important to have open, respectful conversations where everyone feels heard, even if we don’t agree on everything. I just wanted to bring this up so we can have better discussions going forward."
"22650690776","Hey, if you don’t mind can we just talk right now. We don’t get much time together to talk and I rather not hear the news. I understand that you like to listen but wouldn’t you also like to talk. "
"943143012","While politics is a major topic in today’s world, the continued division of communities and the country will not be bettered through this type of thinking. I challenge you to imagine another saying this statement to you, how would you feel about your beliefs?"
"22378004066","Hey John i understand that’s how you feel but irregardless of how strongly you feel about that, you should respect other peoples opinions.

"
"22757378832","I don’t understand why you have to say that. There are plenty of other things you can say and there’s really no good reason to be doing that"
"22184403693","I think it’s important to realize that autism isn’t a bad thing. Suffering because of it is actually suffering due to a world that makes it very difficult and expensive to find necessary support and caretakers."
"22817554916","Maybe try a different situation to say your things but just not in the moment of where people don’t get along "
"22104933708","Hey I don’t like how you mentioned that because her job is well paying, she should stop complaining about the things about her job that are affecting her. Money doesn’t always bypass our happiness and emotions "
"22129717453","Jay i would not like to talk about this i would rather talk about something else. "
"22103727651","Dude you can’t say that, women have rights here they deserve to say things that bother them. The need a voice so people can see the evil in the world "
"22039197384","Honestly I would probably walk away. It doesn’t pay to talk to someone if they don’t want to hear different opinions. I also would probably get defensive and tell them they need to do more research and look at reliable sources. But overall I would mainly walk away or try to say agree to disagree. "
"22321255898","I would like to talk to you about how you treat me when I ask for help. I feel very belittled when you explain something to me and it feels like I’m just an inconvenience to you. I’d appreciate if you could be a little more understanding and kind "
"22406823912","Jenna I do not understand why you often act like you are more important than me. Maybe it’s not how you feel, but your actions make me feel that way. My wedding was supposed to be mine, but you constantly made it about you. You were so angry no matter what plans I made. I was so clear that my school schedule gave me a very small window to get married comfortably yet you continually ignored it. You got more and more angry and even ignored me for weeks until your demands were met. You made the whole situation much more stressful. "
"22127447323","Honestly, I probably wouldn’t say much to this person. They tend to cute people out of their lives if she disagrees with them."
"22112259011","Hey Mishelley, I know you've been avoiding me, and I just wanted to say I'm not mad at you, and I miss you. I mean look--I understand--- no, I don't. I don't understand, actually. But please can we talk? I *want* to understand what was happening for you"
"22037377187","You need to learn to contain yourself in public. Regardless of your opinion, it is very disrespectful to do what you did."
"22042559135","I would just like to know why she’s acting this way and ask her if we did something to offend her. By no means, do I plan to attack her with questions or insults. I would just want to know more about her intentions."
"22210129367","I would politely Aaron why he believes that I am not a good fit for my position. I would then explain what I feel are the strengths that I offer, and ask him if there are ways that I can meet his expectations rather than just throw in the towel. I would be receptive to any feedback he offers, positive or negative."
"22807837864","You know that most of us are actually one check away from homelessness right. The only reason I wasn't homeless during the pandemic was because my grandparents were nice enough to clear a room for us to stay in. Not to mention you don't understand how privileged you are to even get a car, not to mention, a new car for your birthday. You really do need a reality check. For someone who is going into a field of vulnerable people you have no sympathy or empathy for those who live below you, yet are twice the human being you are. "
"22048420631","Ask why she feels that way and choose to not join in when we are doing things. Try to find the root of the problem or if she doesn’t feel comfortable with the group. "
"23363088316","I know you’re struggling with school and you don’t really have time to do your homework. Being a STEM major is hard, I know. But I really don’t think you should be playing with people’s feelings like that. You’re pretty and I know you know your worth. What will you do when these guys actually develop feelings for you outside of the nonchalant flirting? You’ve told me you don’t like them so why are you doing this? And acting like you’re proud of it?"
"126082027","I would explain that I was upset because I would have found a way to change or a compromise if I had realized what I was doing was upsetting this person. I would explain since they never confronted me directly, I didn't know they were upset, and it seemed unfair when they kicked me out for doing something I never even realized. I would also explain that it hurt because I thought of them as a good friend and didn't want to lose them over something small."
"22083465077","If you had a problem with me why not say it directly to me so we solve it rather than making me look bad to someone. How can you also keep something like this for over 4 years. I’m not trying to be your friend again but be matured enough to talk things over with people whenever you have a problem with them"
"22072814591","I would say a similar thing as to Mike. If he were to talk about how rich people should get richer I might just ask him about the consequences of the rich getting richer. What about the poor, and the ever disappearing middle class?"
"22740175926","I ask that you respect my time and my situations as a broke college student, and I ask that you allow me to give you the time and availability for meetings since I am still interested in being a part of this group.  Thank you! I hope that you consider this.  "
"25330009695","I would tell him to not go out of his boundaries in matters that are none of his business "
"110153238","I understand that you had bad experiences with the religion. But it is not fair to not only place us in the same bag, but call us out for something that we didn't do. You can criticize my religion, but do it for things that are actually relevant."
"22252331327","I would point out how protests have done a lot for the country. It’s been a way to use our voices for decades. The right to protest is something we have in this country and students have every right to protest against something they find immoral. "
"22110663780","You sound like a bitch. That is not how someone should think. With that mindset you will continue to get the same result. You need help"
"22989616210","It is a problem, I'm not sire why you think it is not. Please explain"
"22128414857","I was a little concerned about how you acting while planning the red trip because you dismissed our concerns because you wouldn’t be attending. The resulting trip was very difficult to manage and put us under a lot of stress. We are lucky that nothing went wrong."
"22633713775"," I would say “Hi Joy, I don’t mean to bring up the past. But what you said to me last semester made me upset. You told me you didn’t want to be friends and here you are talking to me and acting like we’re friends again.” I would ask if we could talk about it and see if we can find a solution. "
"22043600672","I appreciate your perspective, but I can't help noticing a bit of inconsistency in your actions. It's important to be mindful of how we hold ourselves accountable to the same standards we expect from others. If we expect certain principles to be upheld, we should strive to practice them in our own actions and words. It's all about being genuine and consistent, so let's work towards finding common ground without double standards."
"22888969148","It's a myth that was circulated through social media as disinformation. The source is not credible, and it's illegal to kill babies after they are born in every state. I understand that you hold strong beliefs about abortion and are pro-life, but we should ensure that we are considering the facts. I respect your opinion and want you to have all the facts."
"22767268921","I will tell him frankly what make me upset and resolve it."
"22518596833","I think that voters who only see what Trump is saying are not paying attention to his underlying actions. He has been promising certain things, whether good or bad, and hasn't been completing them. Furthermore, the things he does state are largely offensive and he has shown to be heavily prejudiced and a harasser"
"22733572334","It is not okay to misgender trans individuals, selectively or otherwise. She is not less of a woman because you are mad at her, in the same way that you are not less of a man for her being mad at you. It may seem petty to you, as a cis man. but saying such things about or to trans people can be very hurtful. I get that you probably want to hurt her right now, but think how our younger brother, who is also trans, would feel being in the same situation? How would you feel knowing someone was treating him as if he were a woman in men's clothes?"
"22762837395","I understand you feel passionate about this issue, however it is important to understand the facts and understand deeply about the topic before you make bold claims. I am glad you want to debate your points, however, I think your case would be much more compelling if you had data to back it up."
"22142641696","While you have the right to feel that way, you also do not have the right to make another person feel small. If someone is learning about trans, or is not catching on right away, getting angry only makes the situation worse. Guiding them in a simpler way to communicate without using pronouns or buzz words will help them. "
"22930536161","This may be your opinion, but I would beg to differ. Nurses work very hard. They often work in poor conditions, understaffed, with high patient loads. I believe that you should reconsider your opinion. How would you feel if someone told you that your job isn't difficult and you aren't that important. I don't think you would like a statement like that towards yourself. "
"22455367259","I would ask why she didn’t show up to my wedding when she said she would be there "
"22537419710","Got it. (Actually, I would just delay doing the experiments he wanted me to do. But I would not say no to him immediately.)"
"22311668148","bkhg"
"22493330088","If the person needs defending, that already means they did something questionable. Let their actions speak for themselves. The evidence from reputable organizations show they did misuse this amount of money from our taxes, and you still pinpoint that the people who are pointing out the mistake should be questioned instead of them? They have their own time, for now don’t deflect the issue from the corrupt official. Let her respond to the accusations. And if she did wrong, she must be punished. Help us find the truth, don’t hide it. "
"286482360","Everybody’s vote counts. Even if you think it doesn’t, it does because the electoral college is supposed to vote depending on the majority of what we vote for. Please vote. It’s important if you want better things for this country "
"22751456213","I would say to her that the person she was talking bad about behind her back has actually helped significantly in the family so he doesn't deserve to be insulted."
"22069901468","I understand what you are saying but I believe that you are not following what I am saying. I would like to explain myself again if you allow it. There are other points to every convo and you are only seeing one side at the moment. Let me know if you want to continue the convo now or at a later time."
"22598435407","Hey Bella, I have something I need to talk to you about and I’d really like if we can just talk. Sometimes it really hurts when you cut me off and I truly need to talk about something. "
"22033390846","It could be us… it used to be us [African Americans]."
"22914393760","Realistically, I would not (as I have not) say much. I find confrontation of this kind to be unproductive. "
"22908486580","i would dumb down the entire situation so she could understand it and i would call her over the phone to do it. "
"22057336071","I dont feel very loved when you ignore and dismissed my ideas after u ask them for them. I dont think u really want to admit that my ideas are good at times and so u take them. I dont know if that is true but that is how it seems. "
"22777268749","That wasn’t very nice I don’t like what you just said"
"22849612198","I’m angry at you for lying to me, I wouldn’t have been as mad if you had just told the truth "
"22046456702","I really appreciate that you’re very passionate about politics, but sometimes others don’t feel as comfortable sharing their opinions on it. "
"331032872","Casey, my opinion can’t be wrong even if most people disagree with me including you. It’s called an opinion. "
"349570249","Mom, you don't know them."
"22426061492","I’m trying to see your point but you aren’t trying to see mine. I’m not saying your point of view needs to be changed, but you should at least try to listen to me. I’m sorry if what I say upsets you, but then we shouldn’t be having these conversations. I need you to at least try to listen to what I am saying."
"22861498885","Hey, Kathirine. I noticed that you scheduled me for extra hours with out telling me? Did you mean to do that? Cause I would really like to NOT do that…"
"22405321410","I'd ask where they get their information and if it's something they've thought critically about. I don't think it's rational to hold those kind of beliefs and I honestly don't understand who is supposed to be better off for keeping that kind of content in circulation."
"22919128222","It is OUR choice to have children and have children the way we want or need to. There is nothing unethical or detrimental about doing IVF. It is the only way I can possibly have children, as we have spoken with an reproductive endocrinologist about it. It makes me feel like you don't listen to us or support us in our decision. If we're having children, this is the way we are going to do it."
"22724266144","I would say that our convo upset me and try and discuss ideas to talk about to avoid hurting one another’s feelings. "
"426997029","I would say I don't like how you spoke to me and I don't appreciate it."
"22135693594","I want to know why you stoped talking to me and treated me like a stranger. I was worried about you for a month and only found out you were okay after convincing our mutual friend to tell me."
"22840976764","Dude, come on. You need to understand what I said was not aimed at you. It was a broad generalization. Stop being a baby."
"985890423","William made a comment that seemed dismissive of others' opinions and didn't consider the broader implications of others opinions. His remarks felt one-sided and lacked empathy for those who might be struggling."
"848685437","I disapprove politely with what you are saying, but I do not think this affects my view of you as a person. I just think that you should do more research on who is being killed more, the history of Israel, and their comments on why they decide to kill these civilian-filled areas. I know we share different political beliefs, but I really implore you to do more research. 
But anyways, can we change the subject now? I don't want to accidentally get worked up over this or get mad. "
"22486140243","I understand that what’s going on is nerve wracking and know that I am here for you, but what you said really hurt my feelings. "
"670291143","I seriously don’t think Ron DeSantis is someone worth supporting. His views on trans people are seriously harmful to a lot of people, and I think it’s worth considering who you’re talking with when you express support for someone who is advocating for a form of genocide for trans people. "
"22779498622","I don't think it was a dumb policy I think it was necessary and that it still is. I think its good for schools to be diverse and to consider the background of someone in determining admissions, although it went a bit far by also limiting the admissions of qualified Asian students. "
"118731419","Hey, don’t talk that way about your daughter, it’s not nice and doesn’t need to be said. She’s been working hard to lose weight and it’s not her fault she has a thyroid problem. Please try to keep those comments to yourself in the future. "
"22398628950","It’s not nice to call people mean names to express frustration. There are better ways such as having a conversation."
"22210359708","What do you mean by ""riff raff""? Our country was built on immigrants and the working class. Everyone should be able to find a place here. "
"22768903027","Mind your own business"
"22814290852","I did not like the way you talked to me earlier. Going forward I would like for you to stop saying that or your actions will have consequences."
"22991138331","I think you were being very disrespectful when you made that comment. I have a hard time being around people who disrespect others. I think we can be cordial without having to be rude."
"980688019","ㅤ"
"22036229348","Hey Jasmine, I wanted to talk to you about something that happened during our last group discussion. I felt that your comment came across as dismissive, and it made it hard for others to share their ideas. I’m sure that wasn’t your intention, but I wanted to bring it up because I think it’s important for everyone to feel comfortable contributing. Can we find a way to communicate more openly and respectfully moving forward?"
"22617329752","I would say, I understand your view, but I would like to share my view."
"22682395098","Told her my view on things and then politely shifted topics "
"151313816","I would like to say to Rick that everyone who immigrated to this country worked for everything they have. While there may be a influx of certain people as their country isn't the best and they want a better life, that doesn't mean that they shouldn't get that better life. They are still hard working, they are still trying their best to support their families in this country and back in their home land. Not everyone is handed a plate you claim they are. They are going through their own struggles just like everyone else is or had gone through. "
"22182947998","I would try and reason through it with her and get her to come to an agreement. 
"
"22923109527","I wouldn't talk to him. We ignore each other now. "
"22973731918","I think id need to hear more indie before making my decision, because that’s a pretty big statement to just make"
"22169395352","Again, I'm not a big debater, but I'd show her the facts that there had not been enough credible cases of voter fraud detected to overturn the election and even when voter fraud is detected, they are prosecuted. I'd also direct her to talk to a supervisor of elections since I got to talk to one not too long ago and he was able to explain to me the process of ensuring ballots are correct and not fraudulent."
"22469320509","Hey Edward, I wanted to talk to you about something you said the other day. When you mentioned that people struggling financially just need to work harder or make better choices, it kind of upset me. I get where you’re coming from, but I feel like it’s more complicated than that. There are so many factors, like access to education, systemic barriers, and even just bad luck, that play a role in someone’s situation. It’s not always as simple as just working harder. I just wanted to share how I felt, because I know you don’t mean to be dismissive."
"22317682005","I would tell her I lover her and understand the very hard things she is going through and tell her it some times hurts and scares me when she hurts the person I love"
"22256771159","I value our quality time together, and I feel you are placing other casual engagements outside of school ahead of most importantly your physical health, but also the time you spend with me. Would you consider getting on a better schedule for your own health and the sake of your relationship with me?"
"22767147932","Hi Jessie, you caused Zay to lose out on $50/hr because you thought I was stealing from him by taking $10 off the top of an hourly that I was generously giving to him."
"28751677725","Hey Roadie, that joke you made at X's house was kind of offensive. it made the people targeted in the joke uncomfortable to be around you. In the future, pls be more careful with what you say around others that could be considered kinda rude, especially strangers as they might not 'get it', funny or not."
"22540545880","i would say that as a basic right women should have the right to choose. it is not okay for them to be told what they can and cannot do to their body. especially when certain circumstances are not ideal. "
"390929751","I would not tell Alex what upset me. I would keep things to myself to avoid issues. "
"374831032","you are not the man i thought you were. you disappoint in every way, shape, and form to the point where you do not care about how your careless actions may affect me and my future. "
"22458386980","please talk nicely and talk to me about the problem"
"22292178670","Hey, did you have a good day today? You seem a bit off tonight. "
"26711274098","I would tell her I am uncomfortable with the topic and walk away."
"27538276871","I get that you feel that way but if you look around they aren’t taking the jobs that you want. You’re lucky enough to be born into money and have the connections you do. When you say hurtful things like that you don’t realize the effect because it’s not the life you’re living. People come here for opportunities that they don’t have where they’re from and telling them that they’re stealing those opportunities from you is hurtful because for the most part they aren’t going for what you want and even if they are they’re at a huge disadvantage because they don’t have an abundance of funds and they don’t have the connections."
"22585079540","I don’t think it’s fair how you think you are the only person that can have an opinion. Just because my opinion is different doesn’t mean it’s wrong. I looked to research both sides of an issue and choose which side I agree more with. You only agree with the opinion that your friends tell you to agree with."
"22866325718","As someone who has had covid a couple times, along with asthma and other current health issues, it's not so bad that we need to shame others and complain that others aren't doing the ""right"" thing. Covid continues to change and continues to be similar to a flu. It's not as bad, though we do want to avoid it. We shouldn't stop our lives for it though. "
"22066676445","I'm gonna be honest man, I just don't see how you can't care about these issues. It genuinely affects my opinion of you, and I wish you would just care a bit more about this and the way it affects me and people you know. "
"22344039890","Noah, I don't care about what you think politically I just wanted to make a joke and you didn't need to make it weird by bringing your personal thoughts into it "
"22247488001","John you need to own up to your own mistakes and not push them onto your friends just because you’re scared of your dad"
"22058345451","Can we please have a conversation about boundaries? I want to communicate with you about something."
"22261020754","I don’t feel necessary to speak to you as you have lied to me and used my personal issues as a way for you to get what you wanted. Talking to you has become pointless and hurtful towards my relationship, your son and myself."
"22410420840","Hey you can't say things like that. I understand you were trying to make a joke but it wasn't funny it was just hurtful. It hurt my friend's feelings and it was mean."
"22618398083","Not going to lie we have had so many political arguments i tend to not even try and bring it up anymore "
"947704212","I don't know, Latinx sticks out like a sore thumb in Spanish. It sounds unnatural."
"22329203195","This is not the time to be having this conversation. I am happy to have this discussion, but you are upsetting many who are here by your defense of women's ""right"" to engage in completely unmitigated sexual activity."
"22099477392","I would say that what he said upset me"
"22100122644","Denisse, I would like you to know that I very much would not like to speak to you again. You broke our trust and friendship. My friend didn't deserve what you did to her, and I hope it was all worth it to you. Goodbye "
"22664032648","I would express my feelings about how they interacted, not trying to make them mad but to convey how it affected our friend. I would hope to keep it civil and not start an argument, just give an unbiased third party view "
"22990759275","I really didn’t appreciate what you said. It was kind of uncalled for in the moment and while I understand that it might’ve been funny, it’s been on our minds ever since you said it. There are some topics that you never bring up even when joking. What you said is one of them. "
"22950062898","I just want to understand from your perspective why you believe you are right before continuing with my perspective on why you are wrong."
"22239151109","Hey, about what you said earlier. You know that was a lie and I don't appreciate you saying that. "
"22389086610","Enough Stacy "
"22943482652","You moved into this house knowing people had pets. I understand my cat had claws, however, I do take preventative measures by trimming her nails and having a scratching post. It is not fair for me to lock her up all the time when I am never home but you say nothing about any other pet or animal in the house. It is hypocritical."
"22904074740","I would not. Some people are just too irrational to reason with. "
"22194885034","Calling people these names regardless of their race is not right. These words were made to be an insult and as a white man you shouldn’t even be considering saying them. These words are meant to be offensive. "
"22131016557","I agree that what was said was not being considerate and they were continuously beating a dead horse, but in those situations it's best to tell them to stop right away rather than letting it build-up until you can't hold it in anymore. Being rational is always the best option."
"174565034","I would've tell them this, ""Well, do you not realize that deleting this language out of existence is basically asking to take your belongings away? The english language in the US has alot of history into it and things you should appreciate in life and not take into granded. So, If you love this spanish country so much, why don't you go back to that country and live in ""corrupted country #625""."" That's what I would've personally told them and its sad that ""Americans"" who are born here think they can ruin historical meaning and culture into this country and it takes me 21 years and still manage to fail the test to be a citizen to respect a country like America. I wish I was born here, but I really hate to be put and viewed with immigrants and migrants who don't live the American culture and just bring their corrupted countries culture with them instead."
"22088640947","You should know better than to start conversations like that, especially out in public. "

"22337115974","I don’t appreciate when you ignore my attempts to talk and then you go talk to everyone else about me instead. It really hurts my feelings and I’m just upset over the whole situation. Could we just talk and figure something out instead of talking behind each others backs?"
"22679747720","Please be kind"
"22117041166","Hey Joe, I enjoy talking about things with you, but I think we’d better leave things like politics for a different setting. I’d be happy to tell you about the things I feel strongly about, but I don’t think our conversation the other day was the right time or place for it. Additionally, I try to be considerate to the fact that people have beliefs that differ from mine, and I hope you remember that in the future. It’s difficult for people to be open and honest about what they believe, especially if they think they’re going to face immediate criticism for it."

"22960302155","I'd tell him that God doesn't want us to judge gay people for their decisions. We should love our neighbors as ourselves. You won't win anyone over by telling them that God hates them and they'll burn in hell. You'll only drive them further away."

You kept on dissing him and kept on roasting the poor fellow. Poor guy didn't even do nothing you know. He just accidentally said something that you took hella offensive and then started to make a big deal out of it.. "
"22247938747","""Hey John, I wanted to bring up something from our last conversation that’s been on my mind. I noticed that during the discussion, you interrupted a few people and made some comments that felt a bit personal. It made it hard for others, and even me, to fully share our views. I get that these topics can be really passionate, but I think the conversation would be a lot more constructive if everyone had a chance to express themselves without feeling dismissed. What do you think?"""

I feel like it's our responsibility as Christians to care for the people in the church and the building itself. I trust that my energy is contributing to the spread of the gospel, and I hope you can see that. I'm sorry that my service and obedience to God is offensive or frustrating to you, but I'm going to continue. "
"704289048","I wish you would have told me you had other plans. I don't mind that you hang out with another friend, that's completely fine. I don't have a problem with that. It's just that I had set apart time to hang out with you and the drive from my house is far and we only got to hang out for a short amount of time. And you just kind of left me mid sentence. You left in a rush and I was a little sad."
"22481520391","Hello, Sam.  It is good to see you.  How are you doing?"
"27832616326","Personally, I appreciate what you did, but others were not as happy with this sort of behavior. It may be best to avoid such deception in the future."

I would appreciate if you came to class more since we have a lot to do"
"471391662","Lately, I’ve felt disrespected in a lot of our interactions, and I’ve also noticed some behaviors, especially the way you treat your parents, that don’t sit well with me. I really value respect in relationships, and I don’t think we’re on the same page in that regard. Because of this, I think it’s best if we distance ourselves from each other. I just don’t see this friendship working for me anymore. My mental health shouldn't be better when I am not around you than when I'm with you."

It is disingenuous to believe those false stats and facts instead of looking at the on-the-ground reporting and other truths."
"22756816199","I didn't say anything at the time because I generally try to avoid confrontation if it's a situation that I can avoid. But if I could speak my mind, I'd probably say something like, well yes I think there are multiple ways people can take notes, and I personally find that writing down what the teacher says is useful so that I have a record when I want to review things later. But I'd also appreciate it if you wouldn't blatantly stare at my screen and respect my privacy because it makes me uncomfortable that you were looking at what I was doing the whole time during class. "
"22607287492","Susu you didn't treat me very fairly. Objectively I shouldn't be in this situation and I think it has a lot to do with you. You are being unreasonable. I'm not sure how to resolve this but I feel hurt and disrespected. "

I was especially bothered that you didn't apologize, and continued to say the same thing again and again, even when I made it explicitly clear that what you were saying was offensive to me and over the following weeks when I made it apparent that I was still upset by what had happened. "
"22457717837","Charlice, I wanted to talk to you about something that’s been on my mind. During our last conversation, I felt that some of your comments came across as dismissive, especially when others were sharing their thoughts. I’m sure it wasn’t your intention, but it made it harder for me (and maybe others) to engage openly. I really value your input, and I think we can have great conversations when everyone feels heard. I just wanted to share how I felt so we can keep things positive and productive moving forward. "
"913909966","Hey, man! I know that you weren't raised to act like this, what happened? I know that a lot happened in you're family but we still love you and I want you to know I've been praying for you.

Moving forward, I feel as though we will never be as close as we were because of this. when you feel like someone haws judged you, you dont see them the same. And as for me, to hear that you think I judged you when there was no specific memory, it makes me feel like I can never trust/feel comfortable around you.  "
"22047341296","I would start with ""I"" statements so that I can express how I am feeling and that it is not all him to blame. I would also address my concerns and then listen to what he was feeling. This way I can see where he is coming from and not overlook it. "

"22406636212","Hey Pedro, can we talk about what you said regarding inequality and billionaires? I understand you feel that they contribute a lot to society, and that’s a valid point. However, I think it's important to acknowledge the struggles that many people face because of the wealth gap.

While billionaires do create jobs and drive innovation, we can’t overlook that a significant portion of the population works hard yet still struggles to get by. It’s not just about personal responsibility or hard work; there are systemic issues at play that contribute to inequality.

I believe we can appreciate the contributions of successful individuals while also advocating for a fairer system that helps everyone thrive. It’s a complex issue, and I think it would be beneficial for both of us to consider different perspectives. What do you think?

It’s hard to have a constructive conversation when it feels like you’re only focused on tearing down my ideas instead of engaging with them. I’d like to understand your viewpoint better, but it’s tough when it seems like you’re more interested in putting me down than in having a real discussion. Can we find a better way to communicate about this?"
"157213687","Hey Ivan, I wanted to talk about what you said earlier regarding immigration. I appreciate your perspective on the benefits immigrants bring to our society, but I think it’s important to also acknowledge that many people have genuine concerns about the complexities of immigration. It’s a sensitive issue for a lot of individuals, and while it’s great to focus on the positives, it’s also necessary to consider the challenges and fears some people might have. I think we could have a more productive conversation if we recognize that there are multiple sides to this debate. What do you think?"

Told me I was a disappointment. That I'd never get anywhere if I kept acting like my mom. You just didn't like that I was standing up for myself! Yoh couldn't stand that I was putting up a fight instead of rolling over. It reminded you of her. Of the fact that she never let you walk all over her. I hope I never have to see you again.

What if the slur word you said was heard by a person that it affects? They’d hurt you and make it a big problem. It’s a vile word and you should never say that word again.

I get that you see value in what billionaires and CEOs contribute to society, and I can agree that their success often leads to job creation and innovation. But when you said inequality isn’t a big problem, that kind of bothered me. It felt like it overlooked the struggles many people face in just getting by.

You were always so self centered, and thick headed, like everything you ever heard was just warped to be what you wanted to hear.

When we were discussing about how our days were going, I was being honest when I said I am frustrated by my struggles with ADHD and completing assignments in time. When I told you that, you said something that hurt me personally. I interpreted that as a harmful dismissal of my mental health struggles due to you perceiving me as smart. But it really does hurt, especially since my inability to complete assignments has affectdmed me all throughout my school life, and I am worried I am a failure in kife due to that.

On top of that, I really don’t think that affirming someone sin is loving them if you look at it this way if you see somebody that’s in a house that is on fire which you tell them you know I love you where you’re at you don’t have to change it thing Everything is wonderful and everything is OK or would you tell them you’re in a burning house you need to get out you need to change where you’re living so that you can have life. I think the more loving thing would be to point out, someone sin and tell them they need to repent from their sin just as Jesus did. I think this whole world has gotten so far removed from our creator that it’s easier to focus on this self rather than other people, God created us to love him to love others, and Jesus did tell us. This life would be hard, and the gospel is offensive. The gospel is not following. Jesus is not easy, but once you know the deep ending unrelenting love of God there is nothing more important. There is nothing more important in this life than knowing who Jesus is and what he did for you, you specifically.  God created you because he thought I need you in this world and God formed you in the womb he knit you together in your mother‘s womb. Once people realize the value in the sanctity of human life and how to love one another then, I think this place will be better for everyone . That’s what’s truly important

"22154449842","If I were telling Dylan that Trump would be a good president, I’d probably focus on some of the key reasons people support him:

""Dylan, I get that Trump isn’t everyone’s cup of tea, but honestly, I think he would be a good president because he’s proven that he can get things done. His business background brings a unique approach to running the country, and you can see that in the way he handled the economy. Before the pandemic hit, we were seeing record-low unemployment, especially for minority groups, and a stronger stock market.

He’s also not afraid to take on tough issues like immigration, trade, and foreign relations. For example, he renegotiated trade deals that benefit American workers and held countries like China accountable, which other leaders weren’t willing to do. I know his style can be a bit aggressive, but sometimes you need someone who isn’t afraid to shake things up to get real results.

Plus, Trump puts America first. Whether it’s bringing back jobs or cutting unnecessary regulations, he’s focused on what’s best for the country. I think that’s something we really need in a leader right now—someone who prioritizes the American people and isn’t afraid to make hard decisions to protect our interests.""

"225591218","Why would you talk to someone that hurted me so much? It makes it seem like you don’t care about my feelings and I can’t stay with someone who doesn’t respect my feelings. I’m sorry but I need space to figure this out. "
"22919894767","Milly, I think we need to have an honest conversation on why you have chosen to vote for Donald Trump instead of Kamala Harris. I would really appreciate your explaining your reasons why to me in a calm and concise way. "

So while the message may be okay, the way in which you expressed it, in both timing and manner, were not okay."
"22343991905","Hey Ben, I get that you feel frustrated about job security and your economic standing, but I think you need to recognize how much of a good position you are in compared to many other Americans. You own a house, multiple vehicles, and you have a stable job. I don't think you are personally threatened by any immigrants, and I wish that you would pause before saying anything even slightly racist."
"545790032","I'd tell them that I know the situation we are in is really tough and calls for lots of patience but while waiting we can't blame each other and lose hope until we have an answer. Negativity and hatred won't get anyone anywhere so it's best to control your words while you feel frustrated."
"26463264788","I feel like the right thing to do is to approach your friend and give her a deadline of when she needs to tell her boyfriend she's cheating on him. If not, you should tell her that you'll tell him yourself. The person who's getting wronged here the most is the boyfriend and he deserves to know what's going on with his relationship. "
"22176714644","I think it's pretty hypocritical how you constantly belittle us for not being as ""successful"" as you - if thats even how we want to define success - while also complaining about your work and money and expecting us to feel bad for you. You talk about how we don't keep in touch enough and how you feel like we don't care about our friendship with you, but when you say things like that we are reminded why we don't bother keeping in contact. Just because we are close friends from childhood does not mean you can act however you like. "

"266340520","Hey Akio. I'd hate to sour the mood, but I know you and your girlfriend recently broke up, and I saw on Instagram that she made some accusations against you. I've known you for a long time and wanted to get your side of things. If you don't want to divulge, that's fine and I'll drop the subject, but what exactly happened? If what she said is true, you should know that these things aren't okay, and I might struggle to be your friend after this if you don't own up to it."
"22680352636","Why do you believe that?  I know your background history with drug use (which I won't mention in this survey), but your personal experience does not generalize to the wider population.  Just because you know bad people who use drugs does not mean that someone who smokes weed occasionally is a burnout and the waste of society.  That's an unfair and hurtful assumption to make purely because of their dabbling in legalized recreational drugs.  "
"22307109293","I already communicated this to her, saying that I was not able to just stand by and watch her make such comments even though she didn't mean them in a specific sense. I told her that even though she wasn't from this country, there are certain stereotypes and comments that may be perceived as racist especially if they are aimed at someone of a specific race/ethnicity growing up in the United States.

"22337572010","Please think about a woman who got raped; that is against her consent and she does not want that baby. If she cannot abort because of state law, she might abandon the baby after birth. The baby might find a way to a home, different from biological parents. 
Or the baby might end up staying with mom. Now, I am unsure how welcome the baby is and according to research, the chances of the baby experiencing adverse childhood experiences are high. 
One of my friends had a tough pregnancy when they came to know that the baby had a congenital abnormality and would die soon after birth. They wanted to abort the baby as it would be too difficult for them to bear the baby for the whole pregnancy and see it die few hours after birth. However, Alabama law did not permit that. So, they had to become residents of another state within a very short time to avoid those unpleasant experiences and it was not an easy task for them. 
I wish when imposing laws on people's lives, the court and states could think about the parents and the situations that compel them to make tough decisions about abortion. Education, clarification, and awareness regarding reproductive rights should be compulsory. "
"22287231292","I don't understand why you pretended that we were good for the last 3 years and then suddenly turned on me like that. Even if I did wrong you, I think that you should have spoken to me about it face-to-face rather than try to turn the friend group against me when they weren't involved at all. "
"929170061","“Hey, so I understand you’re a busy person, but is it possible for you to not make plans you know you can’t commit to? You do it all the time and it really hurts my feelings. It’s like you think it’s okay to do to me but you never do it to anyone else”"
"22187127437","I'm a little confused what you mean and all the different things you call out as racist or cultural appropriation. I don't mean to sound insensitive or offensive, I just genuinely do not understand how some of these things are racist or cultural appropriation, or why you feel the need to make everything into a societal issue. I feel as though everything is problematic in your eyes, which makes it hard to distinguish what truly is problematic and what is not."
"22626223753","I'm your friend, and I am Palestinian. You do understand this is a nuanced issue, and our peers gave us many opportunities to engage with news on the ground in Gaza. We are so lucky to have the resources we do at our institution, and you have a personal source of information (me). It hurt me to hear that you clearly ignored the public, horrific, oppressive history of displacement, murder, rape, and bioterrorism via Israel to the Palestinians."
"22350338558","I'm surprised that you, as a 23 year old person, is still able to say something this immature. What you said is wrong because it crosses the line in our relationship and if I said the same thing to you, you would most likely be very upset."
"22163641733","Carla, I think you need to be more careful with what you say, especially in the office. Sometimes your comments and behavior may seem dismissive. I know that this is not your intention, that's why I am telling you this"

"29351055770","I mean, I had asked you 3 times previously to be quiet pretty politely. So I know yelling was extreme, but so is being overly loud at 1:00 AM after I asked several times for you to quiet down. Let me know, though, how I can effectively get you to be quiet in the future. "
"22181512555","We have different perspectives on abortion, and I know its because we're approaching it from different angles! I love you and understand you, but for this I think we should agree to disagree because I don't see myself changing my mind about being pro-choice and the right for people to get abortions"
"22946570646","I just couldn’t keep driving you everywhere, burning gas with no reimbursement. I did everything for you, drove until 1 am most nights for a hour each way. Why does that make me a bad friend? "
"22960308825","I'd like to know more about what you want to happen with the homelessness issue. Because I think we both agree it's a huge problem and not enough is being done. I just worry that you don't really think about homeless people as people, the way you talk about them. And I'm not really sure how constantly kicking them out of certain areas and throwing away all their things solves the problem in the long run."
"22628605023","Hey, I wish you would have talked to me before doing this. I think it would have helped both of us if we talked about how we were feeling. "
"22036119254","I disagree, because many people did end up getting sick when you made sick people show up to practice, and we were outside. You should consider whether illnesses are contagious or not instead of just considering whether someone's symptoms are bad enough. "
"22506563338","It’s not that I necessarily disagree with you, but the tone and language that you’re using are aggressive, and that seems like that contradicts everything that you are trying to emphasize in your argument. "
"456431785","Hi Bri, I am upset by your actions and i think we should discuss how that may affect our friendship in the future. We have so many memories together that i would hate to let go, but seeing you support a man who doesn't believe in the same ideologies as me is extremely difficult.

Despite them being your daughter, you choose to be hung up on this facet of life they don't have a choice in, instead of accepting them for who they are. Society is becoming much more open to LGBTQ+ culture these days and you should educate yourself on what it really means to be a part of this community."
"22208292807","Aaron, I get that we are far away from what's happening and it has little to do with us, but that does not mean that we shouldn't feel for these poor women who are losing their right to choose. This is a clear example of corruption within our system, and it would be terrifying to set this as a precedent for things to come. I only ask that you understand how dangerous this situation is and will be if escalated. "

"22660941945","If everyone uses the ""if one person doesn't vote..."" that is a lot of people not voting. We can't control them but we can control ourselves and serve as an example and motivate others to vote.

"22314765458","I don't know, that doesn't really seem right to me. I get feeling that way, there's a lot in the media and online that suggests that, but when you look at the facts on it really doesn't come through. I mean you could look at marijuana arrests, white and black people smoke at very similar rates, but black people are arrested and charged way more. And then you have the history, not just of slavery but through Jim Crow, redlining, and to now. I get how you could feel that way, but I think if you took a look at it you might think of it differently. "

Surely you can see why someone who's been working here for 10 years would feel a little cheated that someone could start tomorrow and earn the same salary? They feel like the skills and experience they've gained over the years are not being valued. I'm not sure what the solution is, but I do think we need to look at the repercussions more carefully."

I know what I’m getting paid here and if you’re making more than me by more than double, you might be on the very extreme bottom edge of that tax break.

For me, my concerns about Trump aren’t just about policy but about the way he handles leadership, his rhetoric, and how it impacts the country’s tone and unity. I know you see things differently, but when I talk about Harris, I’m focused on her stance on issues like social justice and the environment—things that are important to me. I’m not trying to attack your views; I just want to explain where I’m coming from, so maybe we can have a conversation that’s less about defending our sides and more about understanding why these issues matter so much to each of us."

I remember reaching out to you after watching a movie and telling you that we need to go see it because it was really funny. I actually was texting your number because you had blocked me on Facebook and that particular situation. I remember you saying you overreacted some and I said it was OK it was. Any friendship or relationship will have its up-and-downs and there will be times there are arguments. Again, I don’t really know exactly what I did to make you not want to ever talk to me again or see me again, but I really can’t think of anything, that would have made me just quit taking to you and cut you off completely.

Hi, Dad. Yeah, I have autism. And yeah, that presented me with a lot of difficulties as a kid. I got picked on, I had little to no friendships, I struggled with interactions, I had big emotional reactions to odd things, etc etc etc. But you're wrong about me not being able to be independent and function as an adult. I live on my own and support myself now hours away from anyone in my family, and I'm fine. Having ASD makes me think differently in a way that has always been extremely compatible with academic success, so I'm doing great there. I hate my job, but I go there every day and work hard to make basically nothing, and I'm still fine. I am adult with adult problems. Plus I handle yours. I think I am doing well. And you were wrong about me not being independent. I've been independent my whole life. I never wanted help. And when you left us, I had to be even more independent. Mom was working, so I took care of myself and my sister. I did the things you should have been doing. We lived in poverty, but we were okay. I was okay. And I am okay.

And about Autumn. You don't talk about her like that. She has every right to be distant with you. You left when she was so young that she barely remembers when you were around. She shouldn't have to put up with your incessant whining about how she acts when she has to visit you. She grew up without you. We didn't need you. When we had to do visitation, we cried and begged Mom not to make us go. She was the one who was there for us. She put up with our difficult years and the poverty you left us in and the emotional turmoil you put her through. So you don't talk about my family. You're not a part of it."

Kind of felt like, because it doesn’t impact you directly (unless you try for kids dude, think of your wife), then it’s not important. And that’s just not who I’ve known you to be at all, so I’ve felt pretty confused by that.

"22810921542","I get why you believe that as most people don't actually know much about the transgender experience or the process of undergoing medical transition. But I believe that there should not be legislation restricting healthcare in general, as there are already rules in place that prevents the unethical and unnecessary treatment of patients, especially minors, that have serious consequences such as losing ones medical license, which could  disrupt their entire life. Although healthcare providers, especially emergency healthcare providers have known this for a while based on their experiences, there is now the data to suggest that suicidality among transgender minors drastically increases where laws targeting transgender adults and minors are enacted. Roughly an increase from 7% to 74% which is why I believe a lot of these laws should be repealed. (I then explain the usual timeline of transition for minors and the reversible and irreversible affects of it all, putting an emphasis on how puberty can be traumatic and dramatically decrease the mental health of a transgender adolescent.) Also, that these practices have been in place for years and the qualifications you must meet to acquire such treatment as a minor are very strict and have a very minimal regret rate. Many people who detransition, which is under one percent, do so because of social or financial pressure not because of a change in identity and often retransition later. People who do detransition because of a change of identity are usually pretty fine mentally if they have the social support of friends, family and healthcare providers. I have never seen any specific practice of medicine be held to as high of a standard than transgender healthcare. Knee replacements have a SIGNIFICANTLY hire regret rate than any gender affirming surgery. Which is why I believe everyone should have access to this care if needed and we should trust doctors and parents to make the right decisions as it has worked pretty well previously and the affects of banning this care is far worst than the potential to regret transitioning.

"22911031431","I'm not sure if you're aware of this, but I wanted to communicate this to you. The event you're promoting is being run by the organization IfNotNow. Less than a day after the October 7 terrorist attacks began, IfNotNow released a statement saying that these unspeakable acts of rape, murder and kidnapping were ""not unprovoked."" I know you want peace in the Middle East just as much as anyone. I believe an organization that releases a statement like that - as a tragedy is happening in real time - is not not paving a way to peace. I actually think they are impeding peace and creating more division than anything else. Again, I'm not sure if you knew about the statement IfNotNow made, but I still wanted to let you know how it makes me feel.  "
"22458838230","In all honesty, I'd probably just avoid talking to him about it or just agree, its his opinion. Its not worth a discussion either, his mind seems pretty set. 
"
"22366495927","Well I just did this so here’s a brief summed up transcript.

I totally get feeling like you aren’t a priority. That’s tough and I’m sorry. However, I do think Haydn cares a lot about you, and punishing him for being busy is not the way to go about friendship. You have to tell him how you are feeling, but also recognize how the way you word that expression affects how he receives it. Kindness demands truth, but that doesn’t mean you can’t also be nice."
"22180164809","dont say that"
"22486610864","Is there a reason that you came up with the idea you had? I'd like to understand that reason, as well as any potential consequences of that action. It seems like a poorly though out decision, and I'm curious as to the extent you thought about it. "
"115274499","""It seems like you're almost glorifying people being bombed."""
"22676182850","Laura, I have so much respect for the way that your personal faith in God and Jesus has shaped who you are as a person. I also know how it has saved you from the darkest moments in your life. In my own life, I've found the most comfort and inspiration in the example of the people I see around me. I believe strongly in the humanist tradition, which means striving to be good without belief in God. It might not be easy for you to accept this, but I ask that you respect this difference without trying to change it. I'd be happy to talk about matters of religion with you, at least to a certain extent. I know it matters a lot to you. But I can't accept being judged in this harsh way. "
